Material: Data were collected in 10 focus groups, five with service users and five with laypersons, from BME communities in London. Discussion: Thematic analysis identified that cultural beliefs regarding mental illness reflect four different voices present within the BME communities. Conclusion: The study revealed that cultural beliefs influencing both relationships with family and, consequently, help-seeking for individuals with mental illness must be considered in the development of anti-stigma interventions and when engaging communities around mental health.

‘racist!’: Metapragmatic regimentation of racist discourse by asian american youth.,"Reyes, Angela",Discourse & Society,09579265,,20110701,22,4,458,16,2011-15636-006,10.1177/0957926510395836,Sage Publications,Journal Article,Discourse Analysis; Linguistics; Racism; Asians; Pragmatics; Ideology; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female,,"This study illustrates how Asian American youth participate in the ongoing formation of linguistic and racial ideologies in the USA through the metapragmatic regimentation of racist discourse (Silverstein, 1993). After presenting examples of crying ‘racist’ in US politics and entertainment, this article examines ethnographic and discourse data in which Korean American boys ‘decode’ (Hill, 2009) certain uses of the term ‘black’ as ‘racist’. The analysis illustrates how the regimentation of racist discourse relies on the indexical construal of broader oppositions that link ‘black’ to negative racialized qualities, including deviance, violence, and insults. This article argues that ‘racist’ cries by Asian American youth challenge language ideologies of referentialism and personalism and racial ideologies of colorblindness and postrace. Crying ‘racist’ becomes a rich resource for achieving a number of interactional effects that renegotiate the position of Asian American youth with respect to the range of racial categories that circulate throughout US society.

A community ecology approach to cultural competence in mental health service delivery: The case of Asian Americans.,"Abe, Jennifer",Asian American Journal of Psychology,19481985,143381286X,20120901,3,3,168,13,2012-26526-004,10.1037/a0029842,Educational Publishing Foundation,Journal Article,Community Mental Health Services; Cultural Sensitivity; Health Care Delivery; Mental Health; Social Justice; Asians; Communities; Competence; Ecology,,"Using Asian Americans as a case example, a community ecology approach is proposed to address a gap in our understanding of cultural competence as a systems/societal level construct. A community ecology approach to cultural competence rests on three assumptions: (1) individual psychological distress is construed as embedded in, and intimately tied to, collective experience; (2) social justice is understood as integral to psychological wellness; and (3) formal mental health services are viewed as a primary, but not exclusive, source of care that can help address the mental health needs of a community. To examine these ideas, the paper is divided into two sections: (1) an examination of a community ecology approach to conceptualizing distress, wellness, and mental health service delivery, and (2) an exploration of the implications of a community ecology approach for providing culturally competent mental health interventions for individuals and for communities.

Item level validation of both versions generally supported assumptions underlying Likert scoring and hypothesized item-order clustering. Item level factor analysis supported the 8-scale structure of the SF-36. In scale level validation, SF-36 scale scores showed wide variability and acceptable internal-consistency reliability, conformed to hypothesized patterns and generally varied according to hypotheses in subjects known to differ in quality of life. Scale level factor analysis of both versions yielded very similar patterns of factor correlation, comparable to that found in Japan, but differing from that seen in Western populations.

A comparison of factors associated with physical inactivity among East Asian college students.,"Seo, Dong-Chul; Torabi, Mohammad R.; Chin, Ming Kai; Huang, Sen Fang; Chen, Chee Keong; Mok, Magdalena Mo Ching; Wong, Patricia; Chia, Michael; Lee, Chung Gun; Wang, Chunyun",International Journal of Behavioral Medicine,10705503,,20120901,19,3,316,8,2012-22767-009,10.1007/s12529-011-9167-4,Springer,Journal Article,College Students; Physical Disorders; Asians; Behavior; Sociocultural Factors; Adolescence (13-17 yrs); Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Male; Female,,"Background: Little is known on the level of physical inactivity and its behavioral and cultural correlates among East Asian college students. Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine and compare the level and behavioral and cultural correlates of physical inactivity among college students in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia. Method: Data were collected from a representative sample of college students (N = 12,137) in five East Asian economies during the 2008–2009 academic year. The stratified random sampling (stratum: geographic region) was used to select participating institutions. The overall response rate was 77%. Results: The percentage of physically inactive students was 7.2% for Singapore, 8.0% for Malaysia, 13.5% for Taiwan, 16.8% for Hong Kong, and 28.5% for South Korea. When gender, age, and body mass index were controlled, fruit and vegetable consumptions were significant correlates for physical inactivity across all the five economies. In Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan, those who engaged in binge drinking at least once during the past 2 weeks were less likely to be physically inactive than those who did not. Religion and military experience did not independently predict physical inactivity in any of the five economies. Conclusion: Physical inactivity varies greatly across different economies in East Asia that are usually grouped together and considered a single homogeneous entity by some researchers. However, in terms of correlates of physical inactivity, findings of the current study indicate that the transversal value of physical activity might be transformed into a universal.

This study reports on differences of symptoms across 4 Asian and African-Caribbean ethnic groups.

Wing, et al, 1974) as an interview for ascertaining their mental sate. Schizophrenia was diagnosed using the CATEGO program, and symptoms were compared across the 4 groups. There was a distinction between various groups in presentation of symptoms. Whereas London Asian patients (those originating from the Indian subcontinent) were more likely to present with worry and irritability, the African-Caribbeans presented with delusions of reference and paranoid symptoms. The Trinidadian patients were also more likely to present with a multitude of non-specific symptoms, e.g. worrying and irritability, and delusions of persecution and sexual delusions were rare in this group. Findings suggest that the presenting symptoms of schizophrenia do vary across culture and, in cross-cultural comparison, schizophrenia must be regarded as heterogeneous entity.

Developmental timetables for the acquisition of certain intellectual abilities were also elicited. Culture emerged as a significant influence on Ss' beliefs considerably more than did social class or sex of their child. VT Ss perceived intelligence as more important than did Anglo Ss, had a more narrowly focused view of education and intellectual development, and expected later acquisition of intellectual abilities. These differences were consistent with traditional VT values.

Given this momentum, the purpose of this paper is to use a cross-cultural framework to review published studies assessing perfectionism in members of an ethnic minority group living in the United States. Research to date has focused exclusively on Asian and African American samples and we organize our review by separating this literature into those studies that use level and structure-oriented cross-cultural approaches. Structure-oriented approaches empirically explore the phenomenology and/or correlates of perfectionism within each ethnic group where as level-oriented approaches examine the relative magnitude of perfectionism's levels across groups. The last section of the review critically examines the strength of the evidence in support of researchers’ arguments that certain sociocultural factors, such as collectivism and parenting style, influence perfectionism's expression and implications for ethnic minorities. Throughout the review, we offer a series of steps researchers can take to foster our understanding of perfectionism and its impacts using a cross-cultural perspective.

The CRE reveals systematic limitations on eyewitness identification accuracy, suggesting that some caution is warranted in evaluating cross-race identification. The CRE is problematic because jurors value eyewitness identification highly in verdict decisions. We explore how accurate people are in predicting their ability to recognize own-race and other-race faces. Caucasian and Asian participants viewed photographs of Caucasian and Asian faces, and made immediate judgments of learning during study. An old/new recognition test replicated the CRE: both groups displayed superior discriminability of own-race faces. Importantly, relative metamnemonic accuracy was also greater for own-race faces, indicating that the accuracy of predictions about face recognition is influenced by race. This result indicates another source of concern when eliciting or evaluating eyewitness identification: people are less accurate in judging whether they will or will not recognize a face when that face is of a different race than they are. This new result suggests that a witness's claim of being likely to recognize a suspect from a lineup should be interpreted with caution when the suspect is of a different race than the witness.

Whereas F. T. L.

This model argues for the importance of selecting and applying culture-specific constructs when working with culturally diverse groups. The first step of the CAM is to identify cultural disparities that are often ignored and then accommodate them by using current culturally specific concepts. In this article, several different cultural 'gaps' or culture-specific constructs of relevance to Asian Americans with strong scientific foundations are selected and discussed as they pertain to providing effective psychotherapy to this ethnic minority group.

The studies in this issue in particular put a much needed focus on prevention within the AAPI community and discuss implications for research, practice, and policy. The timing of these studies and this special issue is especially important, given recent federal focus on prevention and behavioral health disparities. The Affordable Care Act (ACA; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010) has increased attention on the role of prevention and spawned the National Prevention Strategy (National Prevention Council, 2011). Similarly, the ACA (2010) has heightened a focus on health disparities, leading to the creation of federal offices of minority health, a policy for more granular data collection of within-group subpopulations, and, most importantly, the first-ever U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2011; HHS) HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities. Driven by the ACA (2010) and the HHS Action Plan, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has elevated attention to behavioral health disparities and maintained a strategic focus on prevention.

However, we know little about how these processes are experienced in different communities. This study therefore sets out to examine South Asian women's views of these processes and how they impact on their lives. It was found that reflected shame and honour (the shame and honour that can be brought to others by one's own behaviour) is called izzat. The importance of maintaining family honour and identifying with it (izzat) was linked to personal shame. It was also given as a reason people can be trapped in difficult relationships. Moreover, fear of reflected shame and loss of izzat were regarded as key reasons South Asian women might not use mental health services. A central fear was a failure by professionals to keep confidentiality--a fear found in other research.

Similarly, studies examining perceptions of individuals whose racial category membership is unclear have not systematically examined responses from non-Whites. This was addressed by showing Asian participants pictures of Whites, Asians, and racially ambiguous White-Asian faces. Event-related potentials were recorded to measure early attention responses. Participants initially oriented more to outgroup White than ingroup Asian or racially ambiguous faces. Shortly after that, they showed sensitivity to the racial context in which the faces were presented, more deeply processing ingroup Asian and racially ambiguous faces when they were seeing lots of other Asians, but more deeply processing outgroup White and racially ambiguous faces when they were seeing lots of other Whites. Still later, responses were more sensitive to the objective physical properties of the faces, with racially ambiguous faces differentiated from both Whites and Asians. These results demonstrate the fluidity of racial processing, and when compared to responses obtained from White participants, show how perceiver race and racial context influences attention to racial cues.

However, the mechanisms underlying the own-race effect have not been well defined. In this study, a holistic explanation was examined in which Caucasian and Asian participants were asked to recognize features of Caucasian and Asian faces presented in isolation and in the whole face. The main finding was that Caucasian participants recognized own-race faces more holistically than Asian faces whereas Asian participants demonstrated holistic recognition for both own-race and other-race faces. The differences in holistic recognition between Caucasian and Asian participants mirrored differences in their relative experience with own-race and other-race faces. These results suggest that the own-race effect may arise from the holistic recognition of faces from a highly familiar racial group.

These findings indicate that the reliability of the survey results is relatively high. The difference between the original and the weighted Korean survey proved to be relatively minor (maximum difference of 3.5%) , and the effect of weighting on the response data proved negligible.

Tests of latent mean differences revealed a mean LOF score that was significantly higher for Asian Americans than for European Americans. Finally, the LOF scores correlated with affective distress and self-construal equally for Asian Americans and European Americans, correlated with some factors in collective self-esteem for both groups, and correlated with acculturation for Asian Americans.

But in exploring the history and legacy of Asian-Aboriginal relationships in pearling, the author seeks to move away from what Penny Edwards and Shen Yuanfang have identified as the tendency to write Australia’s history in terms of a black-white binary with little acknowledgment or recognition of its Asian peoples or influences. The author also challenges the usual bifurcation of the multicultural and the Indigenous in contemporary debates and discourses of race in Australia, an intellectual separation that obscures a history of relationships and cross cultural connections between migrant and Indigenous communities. This article aims to reposition Aboriginal women as central to pearling history. Aboriginal people fade into the background the moment Asian workers arrive. Yet Aboriginal society was integral to the world in which pearling was conducted. Aboriginal people were used heavily in the early skin diving phase of the industry, and women in particular were used for the inshore collecting of pearl shell. But by the turn of the twentieth century, crews were male and largely Asian. This article begins by examining the history of the Asian-Aboriginal relationship and the role of Aboriginal women, and it concludes by exploring some of the implications of this history for contemporary Indigenous identity in Broome and cultural meanings of color.

Academic expectations as sources of stress in Asian students.,"Tan, Joyce Beiyu; Yates, Shirley",Social Psychology of Education: An International Journal,13812890,,20110901,14,3,389,19,2011-20543-007,10.1007/s11218-010-9146-7,Springer,Journal Article,Educational Standards; School Adjustment; Stress; Student Attitudes; Teacher Attitudes; Asians; Adolescence (13-17 yrs); Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Male; Female,,"Education is highly valued in Confucian Heritage Culture (CHC) countries such as China, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea but the expectations of parents, teachers and students themselves to excel academically can also be a source of intense stress for many students. The Academic Expectations Stress Inventory (AESI), developed by Ang and Huan (Educ Psychol Meas 66: 522–539, 2006) to measure parent, teacher and self expectations as sources of academic stress in Asian adolescents, was administered to 176 Singaporean secondary and college students one month before their major examinations. Rasch analyses of the students’ responses to the AESI showed the nine items in the inventory formed a robust unidimensional scale of academic stress, with two separate unidimensional subscales of Expectations of Parents and Teachers and Expectations of Self complementing the factor analysis conducted by Ang and Huan (Educ Psychol Meas 66: 522–539, 2006). The item thresholds showed the AESI measured the student trait range adequately, and affirmed the inventory as a brief yet valid measure of academic stress for Asian students from a CHC background. The AESI is a valuable tool for teachers and researchers, as it provides an understanding of the role of parents, teachers and self expectations as sources of academic stress among students from a CHC background.

Methods: The study was a cross-sectional examination of a probability sample of 3,750 California women. The main indicators of access to services were perceived need, service seeking, and service use. Multivariate models were constructed that accounted for need and enabling and demographic variables. Results: Significant racial and ethnic variations in access to specialty mental health services were observed. African-American, Hispanic, and Asian women were significantly less likely to use specialty mental health services than white women. Multivariate analyses showed that Hispanic and Asian women were less likely than white women to report perceived need, even after frequent mental distress had been taken into account. Among women with perceived need, African-American and Asian women were less likely than white women to seek mental health services after differences in insurance status had been taken into account. Among women who sought services, Hispanic women were less likely than white women to obtain services after adjustment for the effects of poverty. Need and enabling factors did not entirely account for the observed disparities in access to services. Conclusions: Additional research is needed to identify gender-and culture-specific models for access to mental health services in order to decrease disparities in access. Factors such as perceived need and decisions to seek services are important factors that should be emphasized in future studies.

A sample of university students, including 199 Canadian Europeans and 249 Canadian Asians, completed a variety of measures through an online study. Stigma toward an individual with depression was measured using both the Depression Attribution Questionnaire-27 and a Social Distance Scale. The perception of social norms, the belief that depression brings shame to one’s family, a social dominance orientation, and conservative values mediated the relationship between ethnicity and depression stigma with perceived norms and familial shame having the largest indirect effects. These findings are consistent with social identity theory and suggest avenues for anti-stigma interventions.

Cultural orientations have been shown to be robust correlates of alcohol use. Yet, the literature is limited in illuminating within-group differences in the complex relations among acculturation, enculturation, bicultural orientations, and alcohol use. Most alcohol research has focused on undergraduate students; little is known about the roles of cultural orientations in graduate student drinking outcomes. Method: Asian American undergraduate (N = 357, 60.1% women, Mage = 20.32) and graduate students (N = 230, 30.4% women, Mage = 24.76) completed survey questionnaires assessing their levels of acculturation and enculturation, and alcohol consumption and drinking-related consequences. Results: Accounting for acculturation, enculturation was not associated with alcohol use outcomes. Acculturation was positively associated with alcohol consumption among undergraduates, and was negatively associated with various alcohol use outcomes among graduate students. Bicultural orientations indicated by Acculturation × Enculturation predicted alcohol use above and beyond acculturation and enculturation alone, and gender moderated these relations. Among undergraduates, women who scored lower on acculturation and enculturation reported more personal drinking-related consequences. Among graduate students, men who scored lower on enculturation reported more social drinking-related consequences, whereas women who scored higher on acculturation and enculturation reported lower levels of social consequences. Conclusion: These results can be interpreted in the contexts of social norms and stress theory, and highlight the possible protective roles of ethnic society immersion in alcohol misuse.

While there is anecdotal evidence about the pervasiveness of gambling and the seriousness of problems in Asian communities in the US, there is little information in the academic literature on acculturation and its effect on gambling behaviours in Asian populations. This study found that gambling prevalence in the Asian population is much lower, but the rate of problem gambling is higher than or equal to that in the general population of the US. Higher gambling availability in the US, combined with a gambling-permissive Asian culture, seems to contribute to an increase in gambling participation and problem gambling in Asians living in western countries. The results highlight the importance of investigating acculturation in gambling behaviours among diverse Asian American ethnic groups. In addition, measures should be developed that take into account gambling culture in order to design culturally responsive treatment/prevention programs for Asian Americans.

This study applied a widely-used theoretical framework from cross-cultural psychology to identify acculturation strategies among South Asian immigrants in the US and to examine sociodemographic correlates of acculturation strategies. Data were from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America study. We used latent class analysis to identify groups of individuals that were similar based on cultural attitudes and behaviors. We used latent class regression analysis to examine sociodemographic correlates of acculturation strategies. We found that South Asian immigrants employed three acculturation strategies, including separation (characterized by a relatively high degree of preference for South Asian culture over US culture), assimilation (characterized by a relatively high degree of preference for US culture over South Asian culture), and integration (characterized by a similar level of preference for South Asian and US cultures). Respondents with no religious affiliation, those with higher levels of income, those who lived a greater percentage of their lives in the US, and those who spoke English well or very well were less likely to use the separation strategy than the assimilation or integration strategies. Using epidemiologic cohort data, this study illustrated a conceptual and methodological approach that addresses limitations of previous research on acculturation and health. More work is needed to understand how the acculturation strategies identified in this study affect the health of South Asian immigrants in the US.

Some Ss showed temporary paranoid or hysterical reactive psychoses, and marital conflict took place with increased frequency because of the excessive strain on the relationship and the need for constant readjustment to the new environment. Different patterns of acculturation were observed, with problems being encountered by those who were unable to bridge their traditional and adopted cultures. Ss with the greatest vulnerability were those with poor social support systems, who had suffered a greater degree of status inconsistency or extreme personal losses, or who had limited previous exposure to American culture. Successful adaptational strategies included the regrouping of family members or the creation of 'pseudofamilies,' absorption in work, and the development of an attitude of 'fatalism' consistent with active coping.

Little is known about the effectiveness of fear appeals (or other persuasive strategies) in collectivist cultures. Two studies assessed the effectiveness of AIDS-prevention fear appeals threatening the self versus fear appeals threatening the group (i.e., family) on members of individualist and collectivist cultures. The first study focuses on African American and Mexican immigrant junior high school youth (aged 11–16 yrs). The second study focuses on U.S. and Taiwanese college undergraduates. The results indicated that fear appeals should address cultural orientation (i.e., individualist versus collectivist orientation) to achieve maximum effectiveness.

South Asians tend to integrate secular European cultural elements with their culture; however, family and community structure remain male dominated. The study showed that gender roles were maintained through gender segregation, control over social activities of girls and arranged marriage. Interviewees felt that their parents and communities have more stringent rules for female socialization than any other community in Canada. The study also found that adolescent girls perceived high social cost attached to protest and dissent, therefore, they accept prevalent conditions and expect to change social situation gradually.

Identifying adolescent groups that may be more or less receptive to industry marketing, particularly across the levels of smoking uptake, provides important information that may be useful in focusing efforts to eliminate smoking disparities. Methods: Data came from 5857 adolescents (66.6% response rate) from the 2002 California Tobacco Survey and were analyzed in 2006. An index measure of receptivity to tobacco marketing was based on advertisement recall and willingness to use/own a tobacco promotional item. Respondents were classified along a smoking uptake continuum as committed never smokers, susceptible never smokers, or any smoking. Logistic regression models controlling for possible confounding variables were fit to test for the association between receptivity and race/ethnicity across levels of smoking uptake. Results: African Americans (odds ratio [OR] = 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.61- 0.96) and Asian/Pacific Islanders (OR = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.66-0.97) were less likely than non-Hispanic white adolescents to be receptive to tobacco marketing after controlling for possible confounders. For susceptible never smokers, African Americans (OR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.47- 0.93) and Asian/Pacific Islanders (OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.54-0.95) were less likely than non-Hispanic white adolescents to be receptive. Conclusions: There may be features of the African-American and Asian/Pacific Islander cultures that are protective against receptivity to tobacco marketing, even among those who are susceptible never smokers. Prevention strategies emphasizing such features for adolescents of other races/ethnicities may be beneficial in reducing smoking disparities.

Eleven individual interviews, two joint interviews and three focus groups were conducted with health and social care professionals with a wide range of knowledge and experience in palliative care. Challenges were related to a number of issues based on culture, including family decision‐making style, a need to ‘do everything’ and a reluctance to discuss issues surrounding dying and death. Suggestions to increase the knowledge of ACP included techniques to improve information access and the utilisation of shared norms and values to assist with discussions between Māori, Pacific and Asian health professionals and their patients and families/whānau. Findings indicate a need for more family/whānau‐centred models of ACP, addressed much earlier in the healthcare process and within the community setting.

Across 3 studies (Study 1, n = 107; Study 2, n = 112; Study 3, n = 146), we find that European, Asian, and African Americans report that everyday cross-race interactions generate less positive affect and felt understanding than same-race interactions. Yet cross-race interactions entail no more negative affect than same-race interactions. This supports the idea that positive emotions are mostly reserved for and experienced with the ingroup, rather than the idea that people feel animosity toward the outgroup. Given that nearly half of racial-minority group member’s everyday interactions are cross-race, their daily encounters are typically less positive than those of racial-majority group members. Feeling less well understood as a result of cross-race contact may increase the likelihood that racial-minority group members question whether they belong on a college campus.

When directed toward a stigmatized out-group, however, collective acts of aggression are enhanced since they are group-serving.

However, as individuals age, it is not always the case that culture effects on cognitive processes magnify, despite many additional years of exposure to the culture. Neurobiological decline in cognitive function that occurs with age is a cognitive universal and can limit the strategies used in late adulthood, resulting in more similarity in cognitive function in late adulthood across cultures than is observed in young adulthood.

Relatively low rates of agreement (approximately 60%,) between data sources were largely the result of administrative data from patients whose race/ethnicity was unknown, with least agreement for Native American, Asian, and Pacific Islander patients. After exclusion of patients with missing race/ethnicity, agreement improved except, for Native Americans. Agreement did not increase substantially after inclusion of data from individuals indicating multiple race/ethnicities.

The data were collected as part of a health promotion program evaluation designed to help Asian Indians reduce their risk of chronic disease. Community members who used two aspects of the program participated in two focus groups to learn about their health care experiences and to engage them in dialogue about how culture impacts their overall health. Using constructionist grounded theory, we demonstrate that one aspect of culture, the discourses around routine dietary choice, is an important, but under-recognized, aspect of culture that influences community members' experiences with health care. We theorize community members' dietary health meanings operate discursively through a dialectic tension between homogeneity and heterogeneity, situated amid culture, structure, and agency. Participants enacted discursive homogeneity when they affirmed dietary health meanings around diet as an important means through which members of the community maintain a sense of continuity of their identity while differentiating them from others. Participants enacted discursive heterogeneity when they voiced dietary health meanings that differentiated community members from one another due to unique life-course trajectories and other membership affiliations. Through this dialectic, community members manage unique Asian Indian identities and create meanings of health and illness in and through their discourses around routine dietary choice. Through making these discursive health meanings audible, we foreground how community members' agency is discursively enacted and to make understandable how discourses of dietary practice influence the therapeutic alliance between primary care providers and members of a minority community.

Also, the results showed that observer-participants' adherence to the value of conformity to norms was positively associated with their ratings of counselor credibility and crosscultural counseling competence.

The patient reported that her stress was triggered by an argument with her mother regarding the patient smoking cigarettes. After medical stabilization, the patient was transferred to our child and adolescent psychiatry unit. Cultural awareness is required for the proper treatment of immigrant populations. Causes of depression and suicidality are multi-factorial, but more emphasis needs to be placed on culture-specific factors. Depression in adolescent Asian Americans may be masked by stigma, shame, and misinformation. Additionally, many Asian-American parents may have difficulties understanding mental illness due to varying cultural values and beliefs, combined with the stresses of adjusting to life in a new country. This indicates the need for awareness of these factors for proper treatment of this population.

An Empirical Evaluation of Social Support and Psychological Well-being in Older Chinese and Korean Immigrants.,"Wong, Sabrina T.; Yoo, Grace J.; Stewart, Anita L.",Ethnicity & Health,13557858,,20070101,12,1,43,25,2006-22373-003,10.1080/13557850600824104,Taylor & Francis,Journal Article,Aging; Immigration; Living Arrangements; Social Support; Well Being; Asians; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Aged (65 yrs & older); Very Old (85 yrs & older); Male; Female,,"Objectives: To examine, among older Chinese and Korean immigrants: (1) the concept and measurement of perceived social support; (2) levels of social support and psychological well-being by living arrangement; and (3) whether social support is positively related to psychological well-being. Design: A convenience sample of 200 self-identified Chinese and Koreans, aged 65 years and older, were interviewed. Psychometric analysis was conducted to examine the reliability and validity of a new social support measure. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the relationship between social support and psychological well-being. Results: Factor analysis revealed a four-factor solution of social support and adequate psychometrics of all social support scales was found. Multivariate results suggest that Koreans have more depression than Chinese (p < 0.01). Those who lived with their spouse and adult children had lower overall psychological well-being (p < 0.05) and lower positive affect (p < 0.05) compared to those who lived alone. Having more emotional/companionship support significantly (p < 0.001) contributed to better overall psychological well-being, having less depression and higher positive affect. Conclusions: A new multidimensional social support measure for use with older Chinese and Koreans could be useful upon further validation. These results suggest that older Chinese and Koreans' psychological well-being may be negatively affected when they live with their adult children. More depression in Koreans may be related to difficulties in expanding their social network beyond Korean-speaking people.

Findings indicated that family ethnic socialization was positively related to participants' ethnic identity exploration and resolution, but not ethnic identity affirmation. Furthermore, ethnic identity resolution and affirmation were associated with higher self-acceptance and self-esteem, and lower depressive symptoms. Importantly, university ethnic composition moderated the association between ethnic identity resolution and anxiety, such that resolution promoted adjustment in contexts that were relatively more ethnically diverse. University ethnic composition also moderated the association between ethnic identity affirmation and both self-esteem and self-acceptance, such that affirmation was associated with better adjustment but only in schools that were less ethnically diverse.

The authors conducted semistructured interviews with Latino and Filipino academics and social service providers and with U.S.-born and immigrant Latinas and Filipinas to explore direct and indirect influences of social context on health behavior (Behavioral Constructs and Culture in Cancer Screening study). Iterative analyses identified themes of the transcultural domain: colonialism, immigration, discrimination, and therapeutic engagement. In this domain, the authors examine two key behavioral theory constructs, perceptions of susceptibility to illness and perceptions of benefits of preventive medical care. The findings raise concerns about interventions to promote mammography screening primarily based on provision of scientific information. The authors conclude that social context affects behavior directly rather than exclusively through beliefs as behavioral theory implies and that understanding contextual influences, such as transculturation, points to different forms of intervention.

An investigation into Zhi Quan Ju Shi’s coinage of the term Xin Li (Xue) in the late Qing dynasty.,"Shu-Chang, Yan",Acta Psychologica Sinica,0439755X,,20180801,50,8,920,9,2019-08731-011,10.3724/SP.J.1041.2018.00920,Science Press,Journal Article,Psychology; Wisdom; Cross Cultural Collaboration; Asians; Newspapers; Philosophies,,"Chinese scholar Zhi Quan Ju Shi [执权居士] originally created Xin Li (Xue) [心理(学)] as the name of psychology or mental philosophy in 1872, which was earlier than Japanese scholar Amane Nishi’s usage of Xin Li Xue [心理学] in 1875. This paper argues that late Qing Dynasty’s Chi Ping Sou [持平叟], Zhi Quan Ju Shi [执权居士], Chi Ping Zi [持平子], Chi Ping Ju Shi [持平居士] and Gong Dao Lao Ren [公道老人] were the same person, whose real name was Zhu Fengjia [朱逢甲]. A well-educated scholar, Zhu had rich knowledge in Chinese traditional culture. Meanwhile, through helping a few Western missionaries to establish a newspaper in China, Zhu had contacts with western disciplines and gained a sense of modern knowledge system. In an 1871 article on anthroposophy, Zhu used the words Xin Zhi Li Yu Shi [心之理与事] the laws and facts of the mind) from a perspective of psychology, laying out the basis for his coinage of the term Xin Li Xue. The interaction between Chinese and Western knowledge constituted the cultural context in which Zhu created the term Xin Li Xue. However, Zhu’s coinage of the term did not have the same degree of influence as the one by Amane Nishi. During the late Qing Dynasty, with the import of psychological knowledge, Western missionaries and Chinese intellectuals created the following names for the subject: Ling Hun Xue [灵魂学] used by W. Lobscheid in 1868 and E. Faber in 1873. Xin Ling Xue [心灵学] used by C.W. Mateer in 1876 and Yan Yongjing in 1889; Xin Cai Xue [心才学] and Xin Xing Xue [心性学] by Yan Yongjing 1882. Xin Xing Xue was also used by J. Edkins in 1886. Xing Qing Xue [性情学] was used by H. B. Loch in 1886. Xin Xue [心学] was used by Yan Fu [严复] in 1895. Xing Xue [性学] was used by W. A. P. Martin in 1898. Ling Xue [灵学] was used by D. Z. Sheffield in 1890s. Although these subject names were not adopted by later Chinese intellectuals, they were all products of Chinese traditional culture encountering Western psychology. Of particular note was the non-elite intellectual Zhu Fengjia’s original creation of the term Xin Li Xue, as used in Chinese psychology and Japanese psychology today. This paper suggests that although non-elite Chinese intellectuals’ contribution were not huge and often ignored by subsequent generations, they nonetheless offered wisdom to some important events, such as the coinage of the term Xin Li Xue.

This review paper draws on literature to understand more fully the learning process of Asian international students. Whereas views on learning are different across cultures, medical school teachers must understand how Asian international students learn based on their culture. Two general themes emerged from the literature review: firstly culture’s influence on learning and secondly memorisation versus understanding, both of which relate to the learning process of Asian international students. This study shows that Asian international students have a different approach to learning, which is not just about rote learning. Changes in attitudes towards Asian international students may stimulate the internationalisation of a more culturally sensitive form of medical education. The paper suggests further work on the area of appreciative thinking in order to identify the epistemological and ontological dimensions for a flexible approach to learning.

Methods: Data were drawn from the Australian National Health Survey (2001) and each resident’s country of birth was classified into one of 13 regions. Data were gathered on each resident’s physical activity level in the fortnight preceding the survey. Multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for potential confounders examined the risk of physical inactivity of participants from each of the 13 regions compared to the Australian-born population. Results: There was a greater prevalence of physical inactivity for female immigrants from most regions compared to male immigrants from a like region. Immigrants from South East Asia (OR 2.04% 95% CI 1.63, 2.56), Other Asia (OR 1.53 95% CI 1.10, 2.13), Other Oceania (1.81 95% CI 1.11, 2.95), the Middle East (OR 1.42 95% CI 0.97, 2.06 [note: border line significance]) and Southern & Eastern Europe are at a significantly higher risk of being physically inactive compared to those born in Australian. In contrast, immigrants from New Zealand (OR 0.77 95% CI 0.62, 0.94), the UK & Ireland (OR 0.82 95% CI 0.73, 0.92), and other Africa (OR 0.69 95% CI 0.51, 0.94) are at a significantly lower risk of being physically inactive compared to the Australian born population. Conclusion: Future research identifying potential barriers and facilitators to participation in physical activity will inform culturally sensitive physical activity programs that aim to encourage members of specific regional ethnic sub-groups to undertake physical activity.

Based on a review of East-West cultural differences in dialectical emotions, or co-occurring positive and negative feelings, we predicted culture to influence the association between positive emotions and depression, but not the association between negative emotions and depression. As predicted, in a survey of over 600 European-, immigrant Asian-, and Asian American college students, positive emotions were associated with depression symptoms among European Americans and Asian Americans, but not immigrant Asians. Negative emotions were associated with depression symptoms among all three groups. We also found initial evidence that acculturation (i.e., nativity) may influence the role of positive emotions in depression: Asian Americans fell 'in between' the two other groups. These findings suggest the importance of studying the role of culture in positive emotions and in positive psychology.

Responses were coded in terms of 3 quantitative indices that assessed the degrees of reciprocity, solidarity, and inequality in dyadic address exchanges. Results support Brown's description of address exchange and support the universality of the rules of address. There were no significant differences in address usage between Korean speakers living in Korea and those living in Canada. A comparison of Korean, Greek, and Chinese usage revealed substantial cross-cultural consistency.

Research was conducted on 205 participants with East Asian backgrounds through hierarchical multiple regressions. Although cultural factors did not serve as moderators between a racial barrier and educational pursuits, the results suggested a racial barrier in less-educationally relevant occupations, such as politics, and a culture-specific variable, honoring parents, predicted effort-related activities. Further, enculturation and honoring parents accounted for significant variances in utility of education and educational intentions.

Design/methodology/approach: A naturalistic inquiry (Lincoln and Guba, 1985) is employed in this qualitative study. Naturalistic inquiry assumes that reality is constructed by individuals, and there exist multiple realities as diverse people experience teaching and learning (Glesne, 1999). It is characterized by natural settings (the schools), natural language (language actually used by students and teachers), responsiveness to concerns and issues of stakeholders (what is important to students and teachers) and collaborative checks on trustworthiness. Findings: The study finds that the participants all identify themselves as students, while they perceive differently on their racial/ethnic and cultural identity. They have employed a variety of strategies to negotiate with their dynamic, multiple and sometimes contradictory identities when confronted with challenges and opportunities within different social contexts. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of my study lie first in a small number of participants. Eight Asian American students do not represent the heterogeneous Asian American groups in the USA. More students would provide different perspectives and experiences in the study. The time for conducting this study is another limitation. Longer period on the research sites would provide thicker descriptions. Practical implications: There are implications for educational practice and future research to help understand the diversity among Asian American students and to find ways to integrate accurate and comprehensive information related to Asian Americans into the curricular with critical reflection upon the issues of race, ethnicity, culture and identity. Originality/value: This study will enrich the current literature on Asian American education because there is currently limited research in this area. It will give voices to Asian American students and contribute to a better understanding of how both students and teachers are responding to the challenges faced in many schools as demographics change. It will also have implications for teacher education and encourage awareness in this field that might affect future educational practices and policies.

Over 10 years have now elapsed since its publication in 2001. This article highlights advances and illuminates gaps in the knowledge gained about the mental health and psychotherapeutic treatment of Asian Americans in the past decade. Though larger epidemiological surveys point to lower prevalence rates of mental illness in Asian Americans, further advances are needed in culturally valid assessment and quantification of cultural biases in symptom reporting in order to draw definitive conclusions about the state of Asian American mental health. A focus on prevalence in Asian Americans as a whole also shrouds important subgroup elevations such as heightened suicide risk in Asian elderly women or greater posttraumatic stress disorder in Southeast Asian refugees. Despite important developments in our knowledge about mental health prevalence, help-seeking behaviors, and culturally competent treatments for Asian Americans, it appears that troublingly low rates of service utilization still remain even when one accounts for the seemingly low prevalence rates among Asian Americans. Some progress has been made in the cultural adaptations of psychotherapy treatments for Asian Americans. In order to reduce mental health care disparities, greater efforts are needed to provide outreach at the community level and to bridge the gap between mental health and other medical or alternative health facilities. We call for innovation and provide recommendations to address these issues in the next decade.

This may be due to affective mismatches between Asian American patients and their European American physicians. We predicted that because Asian Americans value excitement (vs. calm) less than European Americans, they will respond less favorably to excitement-focused (vs. calm) physicians. Method: In Study 1, 198 European American, Chinese American, and Hong Kong Chinese community adults read a medical scenario and indicated their preference for an excitement-focused versus calm-focused physician. In Study 2, 81 European American and Asian American community college students listened to recommendations made by an excitement-focused or calm-focused physician in a video, and later attempted to recall the recommendations. In Study 3, 101 European American and Asian American middle-aged and older adults had multiple online encounters with an excitement-focused or calm-focused physician and then evaluated their physicians’ trustworthiness, competence, and knowledge. Results: As predicted, Hong Kong Chinese preferred excitement-focused physicians less than European Americans, with Chinese Americans falling in the middle (Study 1). Similarly, Asian Americans remembered health information delivered by an excitement-focused physician less well than did European Americans (Study 2). Finally, Asian Americans evaluated an excitement-focused physician less positively than did European Americans (Study 3). Conclusions: These findings suggest that while physicians who promote and emphasize excitement states may be effective with European Americans, they may be less so with Asian Americans and other ethnic minorities who value different affective states.

Asian-American, Caucasian-American, and Indian university students differed significantly in transitivity and in reported parental styles. India participants were more intransitive and, contrary to traditional findings in the literature, reported their parents as more laissez-faire, individualistic, and competitive than did Caucasian-Americans. Recent technological and industrial advances in India likely explain some of these obtained differences. Predictions from Adlerian theory and work of Kurt Lewin, that parenting styles would relate to transitivity of choices, were indirectly supported. Stronger evidence was found that culture impacts both reported parental styles and transitivity of simple choices.

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual approach is taken. Findings: The paper has argued that in Asian markets culture can be better understood on the basis of cultural groupings (e.g. ethnic grouping) than on politically defined and artificially created national boundaries. The assessment and comparison of cultural differences and similarities in Asia can be conducted by using an 'enlarged' emic approach. Given the idiosyncratic nature of relationships and the increasing significance of the emic contexts enriched by globalisation, the proposed approach is likely to generate a better understanding of the impact of culture on relationship creation and network formation in emerging Asian markets. Practical implications: Managers doing business in emerging Asian markets need to go beyond traditional national culture stereotypes to capture cultural diversities and paradoxes in terms of, for example, ethnic culture, regional culture, professional culture, and emerging global culture groupings within and across national borders. Originality/value: Differing from the 'either/or' nature of the mainstream scholarship which tends to bipolarise national cultures, this paper emphasises the 'both/and' character of Asian cultures which intrinsically embrace paradoxes in philosophies, values, and behaviours. The paper has suggested that an 'enlarged' emic approach to cross-cultural clustering and comparison be used in Asian contexts to better understand the workings of relationship creation and network formation in emerging Asian markets.

Yet, little is known about the mental health needs of older adults from various Asian subgroups compared to non-Hispanic whites. Objectives: To compare the prevalence rates of mental distress of Chinese, Filipino, South Asian, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese older adults (aged 55 and older) to that of non-Hispanic whites; and to examine subgroup differences in utilization of mental health services. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of a population based sample of California adults responding to the 2007 California Health Interview Survey. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine subgroup differences in mental health status and use of mental health services among the six different Asian subgroups and non-Hispanic whites, adjusting for respondents’ demographic and health characteristics, socioeconomic status, and English-language proficiency. Results: A total of 20,712 respondents were included. Filipino [aOR = 2.25; 95% CI = 1.14-4.47] and Korean Americans [aOR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.06-4.17] were more likely to report symptoms indicative of mental distress compared to non-Hispanic whites, yet were less likely to have seen a primary care provider [Filipino: aOR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.18-0.90; Korean: aOR = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.08- 0.69] or have taken a prescription medication [Filipino: aOR = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.10-0.40; Korean: aOR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.05-0.40], even after adjusting for indicators of respondents’ demographic and health characteristics, socioeconomic status, and English-language proficiency. In contrast, Japanese Americans were less likely to report symptoms indicative of mental distress [aOR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.21-0.90], and were less likely to make use of mental health services compared to non- Hispanic whites. Discussion/Conclusions: The findings from this study not only highlight the unmet mental health needs among older Asian Americans, but also illustrate significant variations among the various Asian subgroups.

In contrast, individuals from the dominant group and groups that migrated freely to the host country (immigrant minorities) maintain optimistic views of their chances for educational and occupational success. Because of its historical and cross-cultural appeal, this explanation has been well-received by academics, although key implications of the theory have not been carefully tested. Proponents have failed to systematically compare perceptions of occupational opportunity and resistance to school across involuntary, dominant, and immigrant groups. Using a large sample of African American, Asian American, and non-Hispanic White high school sophomores from the first follow-up of the National Education Longitudinal Study, we provide the first rigorous test of the oppositional culture explanation.

Asian populations underutilize professional mental health treatment partly because of their endorsement of supernatural causation models to explain mental disorders, beliefs that stem from their religious backgrounds. Aims: This study sought to understand the dimensions of explanatory models used by three groups of Singaporean Chinese youth (n = 842)—Christian, Chinese religionist, no religion—and examined their responses to an instrument that combined explanations from psychological and organic perspectives on mental disorder with approaches from Asian and Western religious traditions. Results: Factor analysis revealed five factors. Two were psychological corresponding to the humanistic and cognitive-behavioural perspectives respectively. Another two, which were supernatural in nature, dealt with karmaic beliefs popular among Asian religionists and more classical religious explanations common in monotheistic religions. The remaining factor was deemed a physiological model although it incorporated an item that made it consistent with an Asian organic model. Conclusion: While groups differed in their endorsement of supernatural explanations, psychological perspectives had the strongest endorsement among this population. Regression analysis showed that individuals who endorsed supernatural explanations more strongly tended to have no exposure to psychology courses and heightened religiosity.

Methods: We studied Chinese (n = 2576), Filipino (n = 1426), Japanese (n = 833), Korean (n = 1128), South Asian (n = 822), and Vietnamese (n = 938) respondents to the California Health Interview Survey in 2003 and 2005. We assessed health related quality of life with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s measures of self-rated health, activity limitation days, and unhealthy days. Results: Overall, Asians who reported racial discrimination or who had limited English proficiency were more likely to have poor quality of life, after adjustment for demographic characteristics. South Asian participants who reported discrimination had an estimated 14.4 more activity limitation days annually than South Asians who did not report discrimination. Results were similar among other groups. We observed similar but less consistent associations for limited English proficiency. Conclusions: Racial discrimination, and to a lesser extent limited English proficiency, appear to be key correlates of quality of life among Asian ethnic groups.

Their responses to the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment indexed attachment quality, and self-evaluation was measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Self-Liking and Self-Competence Scale. Consistent with findings with Western samples, our analyses revealed (a) lower parent–child relationship quality in middle (compared to early) adolescence, (b) a significant association of parental and peer attachment with self-evaluation, and (c) gender differences in attachment to peers, with females reporting stronger attachment than males. Chinese females reported stronger maternal attachment than did males, and for females the quality of maternal attachment was more strongly related to self-evaluation than any other attachment relationship. During high school, peer attachment quality – rather than parental – was preeminently associated with self-evaluation. The findings of this study indicate that in a context of considerable consistency of findings with Western studies, parent–child attachment in Chinese adolescents is also influenced by culture-specific practices that influence parent–youth relationships and their meaning to the child.

Therefore, understanding the food culture in the population is important to inform culturally relevant and acceptable public health interventions. Objective: (1) To evaluate attitudes towards pleasure and health with regard to eating and its association with healthy eating intentions. (2) To assess traditional beliefs about ‘hot-cold balance’ and its influence on food choice. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using an online research panel comprising of 787 male and female adults of Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnicity recruited from population-based cohorts and public housing estates in Singapore. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess beliefs and attitudes towards food. To evaluate the association of beliefs and attitudes with socio-demographic determinants and potential consequences for healthy eating intentions, multivariable logistic regression was used with adjustment for age, gender and ethnicity. Results: Beliefs about the importance of considering hot-cold balance for food choice were common among all three Asian ethnic groups and most prominent among the Chinese ethnic group (56.3% Malay, 64.5% Indian and 72.4% Chinese). The majority of participants (73.8%) often consider the effects of diet on health, but also value eating pleasure greatly (84.9%). Older age was associated with a shift in attitudes from valuing eating pleasure towards health. Valuing the importance of food for health was associated with a wide range of healthy eating intentions, whereas highly valuing eating pleasure was associated with a lower intention to reduce salt intake. Conclusion: In a cosmopolitan Asian population, both eating for health and eating for pleasure were valued highly and traditional beliefs regarding the hot-cold balance were held by the majority.

The Attitudes Toward Obese Persons (ATOP) and Beliefs About Obese Persons (BAOP) scales used to measure weight-related bias have little psychometric information, especially in East Asian contexts. The objective of this study was to use rigorous statistical methods to demonstrate the psychometric properties of these two instruments in Hong Kong and Taiwanese college students. Methods: A convenience sample of 707 students was recruited from the universities in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Several competing confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted to confirm the factorial structure of the ATOP and BAOP. The best fit models for the ATOP and BAOP were chosen for the examination of the measurement invariance across subcultures. We then compared configurable models with or without loading and/or intercept constrained before correlating the latent constructs between the best models for the ATOP and BAOP. Results: The comparison in multiple CFAs found that the model with one factor and two correlated-wording-method factors outperformed the other models for both the ATOP and BOAP. However, the internal consistency was suboptimal (ATOP: α = .56 to .80; BTOP: α = .57 to .65) and the measurement invariance was somewhat unsupported among the Hong Kong and Taiwan samples. Moreover, after controlling wording effects, the latent construct of the ATOP was moderately associated with that of BAOP (r = .356; p < .001). Conclusion: Chinese versions of the ATOP and BAOP can be treated as a unidimensional factor for use in Hong Kong and Taiwan university students. However, further refinements of both instruments may be needed before using them to capture the social attitudes and beliefs toward obesity individuals, which is expected to advance our understanding of weight-related bias in East Asian contexts.

Due to globalisation, changing demographics, and a desire for increased diversity, corporate cultures are becoming less homogeneous, thus increasing the likelihood that individuals working side by side to maximise shareholder value will not see eye to eye when it comes to business ethics. Given that many international students who earn US graduate business degrees find employment with US companies either in the US or abroad, the objective of this study was to examine whether international graduate business students, in particular Asian nationals, and their US counterparts share similar attitudes with regard to business codes of ethics and ethics values. Of the 309 students participating, 251 were US citizens and 58 were Asian nationals. Significant differences were found in terms of attitudes toward codes of ethics as well as with regard to specific ethics value statements. Further, in spite of the importance placed by AACSB on teaching ethics, it was found that a course in ethics did not significantly affect Asian student attitudes toward a code or toward any of the ethics value statements.

Experience shows at least that this postulate has no global reach. I am referring to the cultures and traditions in East Asia where other concepts of authorship and intellectual property rights exist. However, Western standards of ethical behaviour in science demand academic integrity everywhere in order to fight the violation of intellectual property and copy rights known as plagiarism and piracy. This generalized claim does not consider the diversity of epistemic traditions which can be also found in Western history. Moreover, it seems to ignore the collaborative background of knowledge construction. This paper aims to contribute to the ethical discussions with another than a moralistic view at the problem. In the first place it has to be asked how the idea of authorship and its protection by intellectual property laws became crucial. It will be necessary to focus on the historical background of intellectual property and how it gained importance in the West and in the East. Findings regarding differences in the adoption of this idea due to diversity in Asian culture and tradition have to be discussed. Experiences in the learning environment of East Asian higher education institutions will be confronted with the general demand for authentic authorship in academia. It has to be asked if the function of protected intellectual property opposes cooperative structures in higher education. The discussion on educational issues leads to the question what role protected authorship plays today in academic research.

African-Americans and Hispanics felt that lack of insurance was not a barrier to mammography as they were aware of free programs. Some African-Americans avoided mammograms because they were fatalistic and believed that a breast cancer diagnosis would inevitably lead to death. African-Americans agreed that social issues, such as drug and domestic abuse, made obtaining preventive health care less important. Asian participants agreed that mammogram return rates were poor because appointments took time away from work. Asian and Hispanic women identified discourteous behavior by hospital staff as a barrier. Cultural barriers to repeat mammography appear to vary among different racial groups.

The authors explored these constructs and their underlying assumptions relating to the social context of Filipina and Latina women. The mixed-methods study included testing construct measures in the multilingual surveys of a concurrent intervention study of 1,463 women from five ethnic groups. An intensive inductive investigation then targeted Latina and Filipina women to elucidate connections between social context and individual screening behavior. In-depth interviews were conducted with 11 key informant scholars, 13 community gatekeepers, and 29 lay women, and a supplemental study videotaped and interviewed 9 mother–daughter dyads. Three social context domains emerged: relational culture, social capital, and transculturation and transmigration. The meaning and appropriateness of the five behavioral constructs were analyzed in relation to these domains. In contradistinction to tenets of behavioral theory, the authors found that social context can influence behavior directly, circumventing or attenuating the influence of individual beliefs; contextual influences, synthesized from multiple perspectives, can operate at an unconscious level not accessible to the individual; and contextual influences are dynamic, contingent on distal and proximal forces coming together in a given moment and are thus not consistent with an exclusive focus at the individual level.

In the present study, Asian American participants (N = 118) were primed to focus on their American or Asian self prior to recalling important autobiographical events, and participants in a control group described things in nature prior to the memory recall. Those whose American self was activated recalled more self-focused and less socially oriented memories than those whose Asian self was made salient, with the control group falling in between. The findings shed light on the mechanism underlying cultural influences on autobiographical remembering. They further highlight the dynamic nature of the memory-self interplay in cultural contexts.

The present authors extended this primarily qualitative research on the bicultural experience by adopting the social identity perspective (H. Tajfel & J. C. Turner, 1986). They developed and tested an empirically testable model of the role of cultural construals, in-group prototypicality, and identity in bicultural conflict in 2 studies with 2nd-generation Asian Canadians. In both studies, the authors expected and found that participants' construals of their 2 cultures as different predicted lower levels of simultaneous identification with both cultures. Furthermore, the authors found this relation was mediated by participants' feelings of prototypicality as members of both groups. Although the perception of cultural difference did not predict well-being as consistently and directly as the authors expected, levels of simultaneous identification did show these relations. The authors discuss results in the context of social identity theory (H. Tajfel & J. C. Turner) as a framework for understanding bicultural conflict.

Three studies were conducted to develop and validate a measure of perceived bicultural self-efficacy and to explore its relationships with indices of psychological well-being and mental health. Exploratory (n = 268) and confirmatory (n = 164) factor analyses on the theoretically derived Bicultural Self-Efficacy Scale (BSES) items support a measurement model that taps into the 6 dimensions of bicultural competence proposed by T.

Furthermore, initial evidence for internal consistency (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and test–retest reliability (n = 51 Asian Americans) for each of the 6 subscales were found. Finally, perceived bicultural self-efficacy was found to be related to bicultural college students' psychological well-being and mental health.

Bilingualism, however, is not a categorical variable but can vary dramatically in proficiency across the two languages. We therefore hypothesised that increasing bilingual proficiency should be associated with a diminishing ORE. To test this, we asked a group of bilingual Singaporean Chinese individuals to complete the Asian and Caucasian Cambridge Face Memory Tests. In contrast to recent work, our bilinguals did as a group exhibit an ORE, however, the magnitude of this effect decreased as reported cross-language proficiency increased; Chinese, rather than English, listening ability drove this association. This relationship persisted even when taking into account our participants’ exposure to Caucasians, own race memory ability, age, and gender. Moreover, we discounted the possibility that bilingualism merely reflected participants’ underlying intelligence. Increasing auditory bilingualism thus diminishes perceptual narrowing for faces. We propose that other race recognition ability reflects the base level of intrinsic, domain specific face memory, whereas the distance in recognition performance between own and other race faces is comprised of a domain general process related to stimulus individuation. Finally, our results have serious implications for how we can interpret prior research investigating the ORE, and culture’s influence on visual perception, due to the confounding influence of bilingualism.

Logistic regression was used to estimate the relationships between BMI, age, sex, marital status, education, poverty level, years in the United States and self-reported type 2 diabetes. The findings revealed that Koreans had the lowest prevalence for type 2 diabetes and South Asians had the highest. Type 2 diabetes had a statistically significant association with BMI and demographic variables but varied across ethnic groups. Due to sampling variations, no meaningful results were found in the Filipino and Japanese samples. BMI and older age are common risk factors for type 2 diabetes among Asians, but whether sex, marital status, education, and years in the United States are risk factors varies among ethnic groups.

Moreover, for European Americans but not for ethnic minorities, relative ingroup prototypicality was related to antiminority policy attitudes and acculturation ideologies.

This article explores the changes that are occurring in East Asian social and cultural traditions for aging and discusses the implications of those changes for women who aged in that culture. In the traditional culture, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean families are influenced by values of family centrality and collective orientation to life that are mostly rooted in Confucian values and ethics. In those traditions, older women assume and maintain a valued status within the family and community through respected roles and productive contributions. However, various factors, such as migration to urban areas and demographic shifts, have precipitated modernization of these societies and alterations of traditional culture. These cultural shifts are relevant to the United States where, according to the 2000 U.S. Census, 71.0% of Asian and Pacific Islander-Americans over the age 65 are foreign-born. Immigration can prompt an immediate cultural shift and create a fast forward insight into the slower cultural evolution currently occurring in East Asian societies.

The first study showed that U.S. and Swiss children advocated for more self-determination rights than Chinese-Malaysian children; U.S. and Chinese-Malaysian children advocated for more nurturance rights than Swiss children. Within the Chinese-Malaysian sample, Buddhist children were more likely to advocate for self-determination rights as compared to Christian children. Using a revised Children's Rights Interview (rCRI), the second study showed that on average U.S. and Chinese-Malaysian children were more likely to advocate for self-determination rights than nurturance rights.

A semi-structured interview procedure was used with 58 Arab Muslim, Asian Muslim, Christian, and Hindu children aged between 5 and 11 years living in North London. Religion appeared to be highly salient to the children interviewed, and findings suggested that children's religious identity is subject to a complex pattern of influences which cannot be solely explained by either age or cognitive differences.

In general, the majority of Chinese teachers (65.6%) do not think that classroom management is a great concern. They perceive 'daydreaming' to be the most frequent and troublesome misbehaviour. This contrasts with many prior studies in Western settings where 'talking out of turn' has been reported as the biggest concern. In addition, Chinese teachers are eager to understand the psychological reasons behind student misbehaviour. They also suggest that the Chinese system of 'teaching for testing' should be reformed.

For simple arithmetic, however, ACs and CCs were equal and both performed better than NACs. The superior simple-arithmetic skills of CCs relative to NACs implies that extracurricular culture-specific factors rather than differences in formal education explain the simple-arithmetic advantage for Chinese relative to non-Asian North American adults. NAC's relatively poor simple-arithmetic performance resulted both from less efficient retrieval skills and greater use of procedural strategies. Nonetheless, all 3 groups reported using procedures for the larger simple subtraction and division problems, confirming the importance of procedural knowledge in skilled adults' performance of elementary mathematics.

Results showed strong evidence for cognitive consistency; the strength of children’s math–gender stereotypes, together with their gender identity, significantly predicted their math self-concepts. Cognitive consistency may be culturally universal and a key mechanism for developmental change in social cognition. We also discovered that Singaporean children’s math–gender stereotypes increased as a function of age and that boys identified with math more strongly than did girls despite Singaporean girls’ excelling in math.

Methods: Participants were U.S. Latino/a and Asian-heritage college students (N = 1,279, 67% female, 72% U.S. born) from the Multi-Site University Study of Identity and Culture (MUSIC). Students completed online self-report surveys in 2009. Results: Multi-group path analysis demonstrated that a fully constrained model fit well for both Latino/a and Asian-heritage student data. The results showed that with increasing levels of denigration (but not foreigner objectification), the combination of lower cognitive reappraisal and higher expressive suppression was related to greater depressive symptoms, anxiety, and aggression. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of examining multiple emotion regulation strategies simultaneously—considering what strategies are available to individuals and in what combination they are used—to understand how best to deal with negative emotions resulting from experiencing discrimination.

There are several take-home messages from the brief descriptions and explanations of the two scenarios. First, communication behaviors and norms about serious health conditions are affected and based on, if not determined, by culture. In many cases, there is no absolute right or wrong because the truth depends on cultural and situational contexts. Second, it is important for Chinese immigrants in the United States to learn to have direct, open communication about their concerns and issues to avoid or reduce misunderstanding.

However, few have investigated the invariance of social anxiety measures that would make these comparisons appropriate. In the current study, we systematically examined psychometric properties and configural, metric, and scalar invariance of five social anxiety measures and four short forms that have been used more than once to compare Asian Americans (n = 232) and European Americans (n = 193). We found that four (i.e., SPS-6, SIAS-6, SPS, and SPAI-18) of the nine scales were scalar invariant, three scales (i.e., SIAS, SPAI, and B-FNES) only achieved configural invariance, and two scales (i.e., FNES and SADS) failed to achieve configural invariance. Latent mean comparisons based on the scalar invariant measures revealed higher social anxiety scores for Asian Americans than European Americans. The findings are discussed with regard to the issues and challenges when comparing social anxiety among different cultural and ethnic groups.

We examined gender role attitudes in two Asian countries (Japan and the People's Republic of China) and in one North American country (the USA) across a sample of 2,832 upper division business students. As originally conceived by Hofstede (1980), the masculinity scale measures the division of gender work roles in a given culture. This dimension taps the degree to which societies either maximise or minimise these social role differences for the sexes. The basic question guiding this research is whether and how masculinity varies across the three nations studied. Since values are the central tenets of culture, the basic proposition was that there would be differences in masculinity measures and the work-role expectations would also differ across the three cultures. Our research contributes to this growing body of literature by adding a comparative dimension to the study of gender differences between the two major Asian societies and the USA. We will first provide socioeconomic information on the three countries and then present the methodology and results of the empirical analysis of workplace gender roles.

Complexity science and participation in decision making among Taiwanese nurses.,"Liu, Yi",Journal of Nursing Management,09660429,,20080401,16,3,291,7,2008-02965-004,10.1111/j.1365-2834.2007.00792.x,Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd.,Journal Article,Cross Cultural Differences; Decision Making; Nurses; Nursing; Sciences; Asians; Adulthood (18 yrs & older),,"Aim: The perspective of interconnection in complexity science is used to examine the concept of participation in decision making among Taiwanese nurses in the context of Chinese communication culture. Background: Participation in decision making among nurses has been widely discussed and tested in the Western healthcare systems. Many studies have shown that participation in decision making relates to nurses' autonomy, job satisfaction and quality of care. However, participation in decision making has not been fully discussed in Taiwan's nursing community. In a different cultural environment, participation in decision making may have different effects. Evaluation: The concept of participation in decision making is analysed in three facets of Chinese communication culture: (1) hierarchical social relationship; (2) harmony maintenance; and (3) insider effects. Key issues: Taiwanese nurses might establish different levels of participation and need to use different strategies to enhance participation in decision making for desired outcomes. Conclusion: While applying participation in decision making in a different context, it is very important to consider the social and cultural differences. Implications for nursing management: Two implications are made. First, nursing leaders/managers who are working with a multicultural team should be aware of the cultural difference in the pattern of interaction in the process of participation in decision making. Second, leaders/managers should be creative and try to apply different strategies to encourage staff's participation in decision making.

There is recent evidence that these advantages differ across cultures and between East Asia and the West in particular, but existing network models are unable to explain why or address cultural variation in general. This paper seeks to provide a solution by integrating a culture-embedded rational model of action into the social network model of structure, using this not only to re-examine the closure versus structural hole debate, but also to tie it to the literature on Confucian capitalism and the East Asian Model of the firm. We argue that this integrated approach allows us to systematically analyse the relationship between culture and behaviour in networks and, more specifically, to explain why closure has been a more powerful source of productivity in East Asia than the West.

Data collected from 174 Singaporeans supported the hypothesized relationships among Chinese values, defensive pessimism, SARS-related fears, compliance to preventive health-related behaviors and negative outcomes. Path analysis revealed that individuals' endorsement of Chinese value clusters--prudence, industry, and civic harmony--positively predicted their levels of defensive pessimism. The results also indicated that defensive pessimism had a direct positive effect on SARS-related fears, and SARS-related fears, in turn, were directly related to direct preventive health-related behaviors but not related to indirect preventive behaviors. In addition to the indirect effect of Chinese values on direct preventive health-related behaviors, Chinese values had a direct positive effect on both direct and indirect preventive health-related behaviors. Consistent with our contention that defensive pessimism has the potential for leading to particular negative outcomes, defensive pessimism was found to influence negative outcomes but this relationship was partially mediated by SARS-related fears.

Racial/ethnic differences in contextual appraisals and coping strategies were reported in response to discrimination. African and Asian American participants reporting experiences of discrimination were more likely to perceive the situation as a challenge. African Americans reporting experiences of discrimination were more likely to report seeking support and guidance when compared to Asian and European Americans. Contextual appraisals did not predict the use of coping strategies in response to experiences of discrimination. Emotional discharge and past experiences of discrimination were positively associated with re-experiencing symptoms. Cognitive avoidance coping strategies were associated with avoidance symptoms.

Using a bilinear and bidimensional model of cultural orientation, this study concurrently examined 4 domains of Asian American perceived parent-child cultural orientations: behavioral acculturation, values acculturation, behavioral enculturation, and values enculturation. Participants were 166 Asian American emerging adults who reported perceptions of their parents’ and their own cultural orientations. Perceived mother-child cultural gap in values enculturation was the most consistent predictor of negative outcomes. However, a combination of low levels of children’s and perceived maternal values acculturation was also associated with greater psychological distress. In addition, the correlates of perceived parent-child cultural orientations differed depending on the parent’s gender. These findings underscore the importance of concurrently assessing multiple domains of cultural orientations and distinguishing between fathers and mothers when examining similarities and differences in perceived parent-child cultural orientation levels.

The present study aimed to explore the pattern and correlates of PIU across different countries in the European and the Asian continent. Further, the stability of factors associated with PIU across different countries were assessed. Materials and methods: An international, cross-sectional study with a total of 2749 participants recruited from universities/colleges of eight countries: Bangladesh, Croatia, India, Nepal, Turkey, Serbia, Vietnam, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Participants completed the Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale -2 (GPIUS2) assessing PIU, and the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS) assessing the depressive and anxiety symptoms. Results: A total of 2643 participants (mean age 21.3 ± 2.6; 63% females) were included in the final analysis. The overall prevalence of PIU for the entire sample was 8.4% (range 1.6% to 12.6%). The mean GPIUS2 standardized scores were significantly higher among participants from the five Asian countries when compared to the three European countries. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were the most stable and strongest factors associated with PIU across different countries and cultures. Discussion and conclusions: The PIU is an important emerging mental health condition among college/university going young adults, with psychological distress being the strongest and most stable correlate of PIU across different countries and cultures in this study. The present study highlighted the importance of screening university and college students for PIU.

Measures included adaptations of the Social Readjustment Rating Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Rotter's Internal–External Locus of Control Scale. Factor analysis revealed that confidence with English was positively associated with linguistic assimilation into English-Canadian society and with several components of psychological adjustment (e.g., sense of personal control, self-esteem). Indicators of cultural assimilation (e.g., social distance toward anglophone groups) and involvement in the Chinese community were not, however, related to confidence with English. Findings suggest that for some ethnolinguistic minorities in Canada, self-rated confidence with the language of the majority group is not necessarily indicative of the loss of ethno-cultural identity by its members.

The authors draw on this analysis to further the debates between psychotherapeutics and social theory, challenging each in 3 ways. First, in relation to the literature on culture, class, gender and sexuality in psychotherapy, the authors indicate how these enter into the therapeutic relation in distinct and intersecting ways, which, second, challenge the separation between inner and outer worlds frequently maintained within psychotherapy circles. Third, in terms of the correlative challenge psychotherapeutic perspectives pose for social theorists and activists, the authors highlight how the therapist's constructive and explicit use of her power and socio-cultural position was central to the progress of this client's therapy. Finally, the authors reflect on the broader questions around the theorizing of culture and gender within psychotherapy, including the available positions and representations of Black therapists as well as Black patients.

We conducted live in-depth interviews over a 5-year period with 270 respondents aged 50 and up (59 African Americans, 85 Latinos, 78 Filipino Americans, and 48 Cambodian Americans). We asked both open-ended and semi-structured questions to determine how respondents viewed their role in mutual assistance in the family. Mutual assistance was a critical element in intergenerational relations in all four groups, as it represented continuity within the family and was a part of a broader cultural ethos of family relationships. There were differences between groups in overall approach to mutual assistance, the factors to which they assigned the greatest importance, and the degree of dissatisfaction expressed over family relationships. Social exchange can be viewed not only as a means by which those who are old maintain power but as a major vehicle for perpetuating continuity across the generations. When social exchange breaks down, elders suffer from loss of power as expressed through role loss.

Methods: A qualitative interpretive descriptive study (focus groups and interviews) in which 65 participants from five key ethnic groups (New Zealand European, Māori, Pacific, Asian and other immigrant parents) took part. Thematic analysis using an inductive approach, in which the themes identified are strongly linked to the data, was employed. Results: Many parents reported they were unclear about the purpose of the tool, affecting its perceived value. Participants reported not understanding the context in which they should consider the questions and had difficulty understanding some questions and response options. Māori parents generally did not support the questionnaire based approach, preferring face to face interaction. Parents from Māori, Pacific Island, Asian, and new immigrant groups reported the tool lacked explicit consideration of children in their cultural context. Parents discussed the importance of timing and multiple perspectives when interpreting scores from the tool.

Consideration is given to the state of widowhood in different cultural systems. The impact of modernization among traditional societies demonstrates that, even though Western technologies are incorporated into the procedures followed by these modernizing societies, cultural codes remain intact. Five questions that require further clarification are identified. These concern whether bereavement is an illness, a rite of passage, or a normal life event; the usefulness of protective factors (e.g., group support) that facilitate successful resolution of grief; the effectiveness of mourning practices by various ethnic groups in preventing 'bad grief'; the beneficial aspects of these practices if taken up by other ethnic groups; and ways in which Western health practitioners can determine whether a bereaved person from an unfamiliar culture is suffering 'bad grief.' Also addressed is the acceptability of Western grief counseling to non-Western clients.

Methods: Parents of 2590 preschool-aged children (P-A countries/regions: China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand; P-C countries: Australia-New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom, United States) completed an Internet-based expanded version of the Brief Child Sleep Questionnaire (BCSQ). Results: Overall, children from P-A countries had significantly later bedtimes, shorter nighttime sleep, and increased parental perception of sleep problems compared with those from P-C countries. Bedtimes varied from as early as 7:43 pm in Australia and New Zealand to as late as 10:26 pm in India, a span of almost 3 h. There also were significant differences in daytime sleep with the majority of children in P-A countries continuing to nap, resulting in no differences in 24-h total sleep times (TST) across culture and minimal differences across specific countries. Bed sharing and room sharing are common in P-A countries, with no change across the preschool years. There also were a significant percentage of parents who perceived that their child had a sleep problem (15% in Korea to 44% in China).

Methods: Parents of 2590 preschool-aged children (P-A countries/regions: China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand; P-C countries: Australia-New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom, United States) completed an Internet-based expanded version of the Brief Child Sleep Questionnaire (BCSQ). Results: Overall, children from P-A countries had significantly later bedtimes, shorter nighttime sleep, and increased parental perception of sleep problems compared with those from P-C countries. Bedtimes varied from as early as 7:43 pm in Australia and New Zealand to as late as 10:26 pm in India, a span of almost 3 h. There also were significant differences in daytime sleep with the majority of children in P-A countries continuing to nap, resulting in no differences in 24-h total sleep times (TST) across culture and minimal differences across specific countries. Bed sharing and room sharing are common in P-A countries, with no change across the preschool years. There also were a significant percentage of parents who perceived that their child had a sleep problem (15% in Korea to 44% in China). Conclusions: Overall, our results indicate significant cross-cultural differences in sleep patterns, sleeping arrangements, and parent-reported sleep problems in preschool-aged children. Further studies are needed to understand the underlying bases for these differences and especially for contributors to parents’ perceptions of sleep problems.

There is, however, little evidence to substantiate this belief, coupled with serious shortcomings in the extant literature. Tolerance for crowding has been confused with cultural differences in personal space preferences along with perceived crowding. Furthermore, the few studies that have examined cultural variability in reactions to crowding have compared subgroup correlations, which is not equivalent to a statistical interaction. Although the authors found a statistical interaction indicating that Asian Americans and Latin Americans differ in the way they perceive crowding in comparison to their fellow Anglo-American and African American citizens, all four ethnic groups suffer similar, negative psychological distress sequelae of high-density housing. These results hold independently of household income.

Theoretical and empirical literature on cross cultural aspects of anorexia nervosa and the medical records of 14 Asian patients (mean age 21.6 yrs) treated for eating disorders in Sydney, Australia were reviewed. Results show that regarding the 1st assumption, it is argued that weight concerns when defined as weight loss that is positively valued (rather than a fat phobia) is a defining characteristic of anorexia nervosa and is not limited to contemporary, Western cases of the disorder. Regarding the 2nd assumption, it is argued that the occurrence of anorexia nervosa in non-Western contexts cannot be solely attributed to the acceptance of Western thinness ideals because values and practices intrinsic to non-Western cultures are also likely to be etiologically relevant.

Building on and extending prior work on uncertainty avoidance, this research suggests that providing mass customization in highly uncertainty-avoiding cultures can have negative consequences for consumers and companies, including longer configuration duration, lower conversion rates to actually purchase the customized product, and a reduced degree of sharing one’s product with other consumers. We provide support for those propositions based on two large-scale field studies involving more than 700,000 prospective car buyers in Japan and Taiwan (scoring high on uncertainty avoidance) versus China and Singapore (scoring low on uncertainty avoidance). Our findings on actual customers suggest that neglecting cross-national differences in uncertainty avoidance across East Asia puts both consumers and companies at risk due to more onerous customization experiences for consumers and substantially lower conversion for companies.

After the cross-national transition to the U.S., however, he confronted unique and particular challenges in negotiating his multiple identities. As a foreigner, adopting the cultural discourse of the gay Asian-American identity as a way of life shocked and surprised him—especially because of the ways in which others communicated with him. In particular, others generally viewed his identity expression as reinforcing the stereotypical image of gay men and failing to conform with the social perception of Asian-Americans. Also, the racialized and gendered image of gay Asian-American men became a conflict in his interactions with gay and bisexual men because its image did not fully represent who he is. Being trapped by his dual-identity conflict, he faced difficulty in negotiating performative aspects of gay Asian-American male identity construction. At the same time, this contradiction became an opportunity for him to (de)construct his dual identity conflict and to finally name himself with such labeling. This analysis employs autoethnography to explore the author’s cross-national transformation process of becoming a gay Asian-American man. Finally, this analysis intends to link his personal experience and the cultural and social experiences of gay Asian-American male identity.

Cross-situational consistency of trait expressions and injunctive norms among Asian Canadian and European Canadian undergraduates.,"Locke, Kenneth D.; Sadler, Pamela; McDonald, Kelly",Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology,10999809,,20190401,25,2,210,10,2018-28125-001,10.1037/cdp0000195,Educational Publishing Foundation,Journal Article,Cross Cultural Differences; Immigration; Interpersonal Interaction; Personality Traits; Social Norms; Asians; Racial and Ethnic Differences; Self-Concept; Test Construction; Whites; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female,,"Objective: In the current paper, we sought to clarify when and why Asian Americans/Canadians and European Americans/Canadians differ in self-consistency (the consistency of personality traits across situations). Method: European Canadian (n = 220) and second-generation Asian Canadian (n = 166) undergraduates (Mage = 19 years) described the traits they expressed and the traits others wanted them to express (i.e., injunctive norms, or injunctions) in four different social situations (i.e., with parents, with friends, with siblings, and with professors). Results: Self-consistency was greater among European Canadians than Asian Canadians, but only when comparing behavior with parents versus with peers (i.e., friends and siblings). The same pattern was found for injunctive consistency (cross-situational consistency of trait injunctions). Injunctions strongly predicted the behavior of both Asian and European Canadians, but because the injunctions from parents versus peers diverged more for Asian Canadians, so did their behaviors. Controlling for the effect of inconsistent injunctions across situations eliminated the ethnic difference in self-consistency. Finally, Asian Canadians who perceived their immigrant parents as embracing a Canadian identity were as cross-situationally consistent as European Canadians because they tended to behave—and believe their parents approved of their behaving—with parents similarly to how they behaved with peers (e.g., more carefree and outspoken). Conclusion: Contrary to previous theorizing, cultural influences on broad cognitive or motivational dispositions (e.g., dialecticism, collectivism) alone cannot explain the observed pattern of ethnic differences in consistency. To understand when bicultural individuals are less consistent across situations also requires an understanding of the specific situations across which they tend to encounter divergent social norms.

A total of 364 participants completed a 65-item questionnaire, containing general questions regarding depression and anti-depressive behaviour; the causes of depression, and treatments for depression. The hypotheses were broadly supported; there were significant interactions between ethnicity and age, which generally revealed an increasingly negative attitude towards depression with increasing age amongst British Bangladeshis. Older British Bangladeshis believed depression was an illness that brought a sense of shame and loss of dignity to the individual and his or her family, and they also favoured a lay referral system for sufferers. They also had more superstitious beliefs about depression than both younger British Bangladeshis and British Whites. A pattern of increasing negativity with increasing age was not evident amongst the British Whites, but older individuals in both groups tended to believe that depression was not helped by psychological intervention. The attitudes towards depression in the young was similar (and generally positive) in both ethnic groups. These findings highlight the necessity to provide more culturally sensitive and accessible services for migrant communities—particularly amongst older individuals.

Norms regarding appropriate amount, content, and type of self-disclosure differ noticeably between Asian and American cultures. In general, Asians have been found to be more guarded in their self-disclosure than their American counterparts. Such differences may hinder the formation of relationships between Asian immigrants and Americans. Thus, it is important for psychologists to examine culture-specific and non-culture-specific correlates of guarded self-disclosure among Asian immigrants in the United States. However, to date, there has been a dearth of studies examining this topic. This paucity of research is somewhat surprising given the large number of Asian immigrants in the United States.

To investigate whether such cultural difference in self-related processing extends to face recognition, we recorded event-related potentials from British and Chinese subjects while they judged head orientations of their own face or a familiar face in visual displays. For the British, the own-face induced faster responses and a larger negative activity at 280-340 ms over the frontal-central area (N2) relative to the familiar face. In contrast, the Chinese showed weakened self-advantage in behavioral responses and reduced anterior N2 amplitude to the own-face compared with the familiar face. Our findings suggest that enhanced social salience of one's own face results in different neurocognitive processes of self-recognition in Western and Chinese cultures.

Building on prior research that has compared the cultural differences on past, present, and future orientation, this review hypothesizes that East Asians focus on the past and future more than North Americans, and North Americans focus on the present more than East Asians. It is suggested that in addition to a cultural difference in the focus on the 3 temporal domains, when moving from any past or future time point toward the present, North Americans’ focus on the temporal domain grows more than East Asians’ focus. I present evidence in three categories based on how temporal orientation is defined. Specially, I compare East Asians’ and North Americans’ focus on a temporal domain, their mental representation of a temporal domain and their subjective temporal distance to a temporal domain.

Norenzayan et al. concluded that Koreans are less likely than European Americans to decontextualize an argument's content from its logical structure, as Koreans were more likely to consider the believability of the conclusion when assessing an argument's validity (a belief bias). Notably, Korean participants were more conservative (less likely to say an argument is valid) than European American participants when assessing arguments. An analysis of the average of the hit and correct rejection rates in each of the conditions (abstract, concrete-believable, concrete-nonbelievable) revealed that, contrary to conclusions of Norenzayan et al., European Americans were no better than Koreans at determining the validity of concrete deductive arguments with conclusions varying in believability.

The Chinese also required fewer working-memory resources than did the Belgians and Canadians. However, the Chinese chose less adaptively from the available strategies than did the Belgians and Canadians. These cultural differences in math problem solving are likely the result of different instructional approaches during elementary school (practice and training in Asian countries vs. exploration and flexibility in non-Asian countries), differences in the number language, and informal cultural norms and standards.

Given the high prevalence of depression in China and Taiwan, it is important to develop measures that facilitate the examination of cultural similarities and differences in ER. The reward probability index (RPI) assesses ER through items measuring individual access to rewarding (Reward Probability) and aversive (Environmental Suppressor) events. The purpose of the current study is to translate the RPI into Chinese (C-RPI) and to study cultural difference in ER by examining structural- and item-level differences in RPI functioning. A total of 930 college students were recruited from China (n = 300), Taiwan (n = 300), and the United States (n = 330). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to study the configural invariance of the RPI and C-RPI. Item response theory-based differential item functioning (DIF) testing was used to study item level differences in functioning between the RPI and C-RPI. Results overall support the established RPI structure in all three regions. Most Reward Probability items exhibit no DIF across cultures, while most Environmental Suppressor items exhibit DIF across cultures. Findings highlight cultural difference in ER constructs and cultural factors contributing to the observed DIF. The assessment and clinical implications of the findings are also discussed.

If East Asians have a heightened tendency to see both positive and negative aspects of an object or issue, but a lesser inclination to resolve these inconsistencies, East Asians (vs. European North Americans) may experience more difficulty in committing to an action, and thus be more indecisive. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that East Asian Canadians scored higher on a measure of chronic indecisiveness than did European Canadians and South Asian Canadians, and that naïve dialecticism and need for cognition mediated the relationship between culture and indecisiveness. These results add to the extant literature on indecisiveness, demonstrating cultural variations in indecisiveness and an underlying cultural factor that is responsible for these cultural differences.

Collectivistic cultures value conformity, social harmony, and social status hierarchies, which demand sensitivity and focus to broader social contexts, such that attention is directed to contextual emotion information to effectively function within constrained social roles and suppress incongruent personal emotions. By contrast, individualistic cultures valuing autonomy and personal aspirations are more likely to attend to central emotion information and to reappraise emotions to avoid negative emotional experience. Here we examined how culture affects perceptual strategies employed during emotion regulation, particularly during cognitive reappraisal and emotional suppression. Eye movements were measured while healthy young adult participants viewed negative International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images and regulated emotions by using either strategies of reappraisal (19 Asian American, 21 Caucasian American) or suppression (21 Asian American, 23 Caucasian American). After image viewing, participants rated how negative they felt as a measure of subjective emotional experience. Consistent with prior studies, reappraisers made lower negative valence ratings after regulating emotions than suppressers across both Asian American and Caucasian American groups. Although no cultural variation was observed in subjective emotional experience during emotion regulation, we found evidence of cultural variation in perceptual strategies used during emotion regulation. During middle and late time periods of emotional suppression, Asian American participants made significantly fewer fixations to emotionally salient areas than Caucasian American participants. These results indicate cultural variation in perceptual differences underlying emotional suppression, but not cognitive reappraisal.

The present study examined whether this in-group advantage also existed for the recognition of subdued expressions.

An in-group advantage was found at the low and moderate intensity levels for angry expressions (the effect was partial at moderate intensity), and at the moderate intensity level for sad expressions. But at milder expression intensities, the in-group advantage disappeared, replaced by a main cultural effect in recognition accuracy. American judges were more accurate than Chinese judges in judging both Caucasian and Chinese expressions at the subtle intensity level for angry expressions and at both the subtle and low intensity levels for sad expressions. The present findings suggest that the in-group advantage resides in recognizing expressions of mid-range intensities but diminishes in recognizing milder expressions, and when the in-group advantage stops, cultural differences in sensitivity to very subtle expressions come to fore, at least for negative emotions involving potential threats to social harmony. The present findings suggest that Americans may be better able to detect very subtle facial expressions of sadness and anger, which may have implications for our understanding of cross-cultural differences in emotion.

Following an extensive medical evaluation, the patient was given a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder vs schizophrenia, paranoid type, and was treated with low doses of haloperidol which appeared to substantially reduce his hallucinations and delusional thinking. However, it remains unclear whether haloperidol or the cessation of the practice of Qi-gong was responsible for these improvements.

Results of three experiments demonstrate that when an extension is psychologically close and construed at a concrete level, Asians' disposition to engage in relational thinking leads them to perceive the extension to be relatively more similar to the parent, leading them to evaluate the extension more favorably than do Westerners. On the other hand, when the extension is psychologically distant and construed at an abstract level and thus Asians are unlikely to engage in relational processing, their prevention focus leads them to perceive the extension to be riskier and evaluate it less favorably than do Westerners.

Seventy-eight students in four cultural groups (Asian-American, Hispanic-American, African-American and White-American) watched four video lesson segments and completed a questionnaire on interpersonal teacher behavior. Asian-American students felt the teachers displayed more uncertainty than their peers from other ethnic groups, while students mainly speaking Spanish at home perceived more helpful, friendly and understanding behavior.

Interdependent self-construal predisposes a person to develop sociotropy and consequent depression via a heightened level of anxiety. Despite this indirect pathway from interdependent self-construal to depression, however, interdependent self-construal in and of itself was found to be negatively related to depression. On the other hand, independent self-construal protects a person from developing sociotropy and subsequent distress experiences.

Through the use of cultural priming methodologies, investigators have demonstrated that biculturals, or individuals who have experienced and identify with more than one culture, can switch between various 'cultural frames of reference' in response to corresponding social cues (Hong, Morris, Chiu, & Benet-Martinez, 2000). Drawing on this work on the cognitive implications of biculturalism, the purpose of the present study was to examine the assumption that independent and interdependent self-construals are associated with the motivational standards of self-enhancement and self-criticism, respectively. More specifically, the effects of differential primes of self on ratings of self-enhancement were investigated in a sample of bicultural Asian American (N = 42) and Anglo American (N = 60) college students; overall, more similarities than differences were noted between the two groups. It was hypothesized that Anglo American students would display marked tendencies toward self-enhancement. However, this hypothesis was not supported. Nevertheless, consistent prime effects were observed for a selected number of ratings related to academic virtues, with those who received an independent-self prime often exhibiting greater self-enhancing tendencies than those who received an interdependent-self prime. For example, participants in the independent-self condition reported on average significantly higher ratings for self-discipline and initiative, as well as the degree to which they perceived themselves to be hard working. Implications for the work on self-representations, motivation, and acculturation are discussed.

Moreover, OST-CA was superior to OST-S for several outcomes. For catastrophic thinking and general fear, moderator analyses indicated that low-acculturation Asian Americans benefitted more from OST-CA than OST-S, whereas both treatments were equally effective for high-acculturation participants. Although cultural process factors (e.g., facilitating emotional control, exploiting the vertical therapist–client relationship) and working alliance were predictive of positive outcomes, they did not mediate treatment effects.

Conclusions: This Korean immigrant child did not receive culturally and linguistically competent care. His diagnosis was delayed and his engagement in ongoing treatment was problematic. Language problems and unfamiliarity with the health care system posed difficulties for the child's caregivers in accessing and participating in care and community resources. The parents experienced guilt, conflict, frustration, and isolation from viable support communities, even the Korean-American religious community. Practice implications: Health care professionals need to provide culturally and linguistically competent care to help to decrease the disparities in health status and health care access.

Pole, J. P. Gone and M. Kulkarni (see record [rid]2008-02186-004[/rid]). Cultural context is a relevant factor in understanding the development, maintenance, and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Evidence suggests that the reexperiencing and arousal symptoms of PTSD represent a universal response to trauma observable across many ethnocultural groups. Variation in the expression of this response may be related to the influence of culture on the avoidance and numbing reactions to trauma. Thus, a central challenge for culturally competent treatment of PTSD does not appear to be whether to utilize empirically supported treatments for PTSD, but rather how to effectively engage individuals of various cultures in these interventions and how to address ethnocultural sources of avoidance in the maintenance of PTSD. The enormity of cultural diversity, however, presents a challenge to the task of adapting and empirically testing empirically supported treatments. An ideographic transcultural approach to cultural competency is proposed.

Many depressed Chinese people do not report feeling sad, but rather express boredom, discomfort, feelings of inner pressure, and symptoms of pain, dizziness, and fatigue. These culturally coded symptoms may confound diagnosis among Chinese immigrants in the United States, many of whom find the diagnosis of depression morally unacceptable and experientially meaningless; this cultural pattern changes over time but continues to diverge significantly from the experiences of other groups. Culture confounds diagnosis and management by influencing not only the experience of depression, but also the seeking of help, patient-practitioner communication, and professional practice. Culture also affects the interaction of risk factors with social supports and protective psychological factors that contributes to depression in the first place. Clinicians must therefore, evaluate the culturally relevant aspects of the stresses and support in the life of a depressed patient. For instance, poverty and joblessness frequently intensify cultural issues. Moreover, the conventional belief that minority groups have strong extended-family ties may not be accurate, but cultural forms of resilience should be considered.

Using data collected from 150 Filipino and 188 Korean American parents (mostly mothers) in the Midwest region in 2013, the measures were examined for validity and reliability for each group and, when appropriate, for cross‐cultural equivalence across the groups. Several scales and their items showed high quality psychometric properties and are ready for use to more accurately assess family process of each target group and to conduct comparative analyses. The findings also show that, contrary to the expectation, Filipino American families express more traditional aspects of familism than do Korean American families, and are more likely to reinforce traditional familism beliefs and behaviors among their children. This study reinforces a need for more empirical‐ and subgroup‐specific research effort.

Supporting predictions, Study 1a found that Asian Americans were less consistent in their self-descriptions across relationship contexts than were European Americans. Yet Study 1b, a short-term longitudinal study, found that Asian Americans' self-descriptions nonetheless showed high consistency within these contexts over time. Together, these findings suggest that for Asian Americans self-concept stability derives from defining the self in 'if-then' terms, that is, as variable across relationship contexts but stable within them. In Studies 2a and 2b, parallel consistency effects emerged for 2 core motivational facets of the self-concept: self-view importance and self-enhancement. Moreover, dialectical beliefs mediated the cultural difference in consistency across contexts. Overall, the results demonstrate both the robustness and the boundaries of cultural differences in self-concept consistency as well as the importance of examining multiple forms of stability in the self-concept.

To test these predictions, we adopted the parietal late positive potential (LPP) of the event-related potential as an objective indicator of emotional processing.

Stability attributions mediated the relation between cultural orientation and active and avoidant coping. Participants in the IND-PRIME condition were more likely to attribute the stressor’s cause to temporary factors, and these unstable attributions were in turn linked to more active coping and less avoidant coping. Controllability attributions also mediated the link between cultural orientation and active coping, albeit inconsistently, suggesting a suppressor effect.

Furthermore, distress measures varied inversely with relative self-enhancement, an indigenous constituent of the independent self but not of the interdependent self. Results suggest that certain commonly used measures of depression and social anxiety may tend to equate the moderately self-enhancing goals of an independent self with mental health, whereas responses reflecting culturally prescribed goals of an interdependent self may be seen as indicating emotional distress.

Although the total amount of time spent on extracurricular activity was similar, Asian-Australian adolescents undertook significantly more homework after school while Caucasian-Australian adolescents spent more time undertaking paid work, sports, and exercise. Regression analyses revealed that extracurricular activity including homework was not predictive of sleep length in either Asian or Caucasian adolescents. Further analyses revealed that predictors of mental health were most evident in Caucasian-Australian adolescents. In the latter group, female gender, less time spent on non-homework activities, shorter sleep and daytime sleepiness were associated with depressed mood while female gender, increased homework time and daytime sleepiness were associated with increased study/interpersonal stress. These findings highlight the importance of culture in understanding the role of extracurricular activity on sleep and mental health in senior school students.

Neural correlates of these different culture-related visual processing styles have been reported in the ventral-visual and fronto-parietal regions. We conducted an fMRI study of East Asians and Westerners on a visuospatial judgment task that involved relative, contextual judgments, which are typically more challenging for Westerners. Participants judged the relative distances between a dot and a line in visual stimuli during task blocks and alternated finger presses during control blocks. Behaviorally, East Asians responded faster than Westerners, reflecting greater ease of the task for East Asians. In response to the greater task difficulty, Westerners showed greater neural engagement compared to East Asians in frontal, parietal, and occipital areas. Moreover, Westerners also showed greater suppression of the default network—a brain network that is suppressed under condition of high cognitive challenge. This study demonstrates for the first time that cultural differences in visual attention during a cognitive task are manifested both by differences in activation in fronto-parietal regions as well as suppression in default regions.

For Asian Americans, concern about social standing is a risk factor among those hold misogynous beliefs and who use alcohol before sex. Concern about the negative reputational impact of sexual aggression is a protective factor among Asian Americans who do not hold these negative attitudes. A European American model suggested only an intrapersonal path to sexual aggression consisting of misogynous beliefs, with interpersonal variables not being predictive of sexual aggression.

Results suggest that each person is a constellation of many parts, some of which are stronger than others but any of which can be drawn out in response to a particular set of circumstances, resulting in a contextual and interactive model of identity. Four factors are described as central to this 'intraindividual' model: individual characteristics, situational conditions, social conditions, and societal conditions. Additionally, the model includes a biographical component reflected in changes in identity that occur over time. Findings are discussed as they relate to identity theory.

Personal interviews were conducted with 60 Asian Canadians (mean age range 41–43 yrs) in a northern community in the province of British Columbia. Content analyses revealed six themes that defined a mental health problem: (1) feeling a lack of purpose in life, (2) feeling lonely, (3) difficulties understanding and dealing with a new environment, (4) high anxiety levels, (5) descriptions of mental health problems as somatic illnesses, and (6) perceptions of mental illness as serious and potentially not treatable. It was also found that poor English language ability and a lack of understanding of mainstream culture were major barriers to accessing mental health facilities. Findings of this study provide valuable insights concerning Asian immigrants' hesitancy to access and utilize mainstream mental health facilities. The many poignant personal anecdotes illustrate that the migration and adaptation processes can be painful and full of anguish.

Evidence that does exist suggests that the consequences of care-giving are significant but different from those experienced by white carers and are mediated by a number of culture-related factors. These include: ethnically specific conceptualisations of dementia; expectations of family duty; religiosity; the adoption of positive re-appraisal strategies, and beneficial outcomes. Present approaches to research are narrow, do not take account of cultural dimensions and employ terminology and care-giving frameworks which are of limited relevance. That the evidence base is characterised by small-scale studies, and weak methodology further undermines its validity. Research deficits are systemic and fundamental and are both conceptual and methodological. A key contribution would be the development of a multidimensional theoretical model that takes account of the role played by culture, ethnicity and structural inequality in shaping care-giving experiences and profiles. Incorporating the perspectives of black and Asian carers, and the influence of the life course of individuals and communities and employing qualitative methods would also influence the direction of research, improve its quality and generate knowledge in this underdeveloped field.

The objectives of this review are to identify and appraise depression treatment studies tested with samples of U.S. racial and ethnic minority older adults. We include an appraisal of sociocultural adaptations made to the depression treatments in studies meeting our final criteria. Systematic search methods were utilized to identify research published between 1990 and 2010 that describe depression treatment outcomes for older adults by racial/ethnic group, or for samples of older adults who are primarily (i.e., >50%) racial/ethnic minorities. Twenty-three unduplicated articles included older adults and seven met all inclusion criteria. Favorable depression treatment effects were observed for older minorities across five studies that took place in different types of settings and with varying levels of sociocultural adaptations. The effectiveness of depression care remains mixed, although collaborative or integrated care shows promise for African Americans and Latinos. The degree to which the findings generalize to non–English-speaking, low acculturated, and low-income older persons, and to other older minority groups (i.e., Asian and Pacific Islanders, and American Indian and Alaska Natives), remains unclear. Given the high disease burden among older minorities with depression, it is imperative to provide timely, accessible, and effective depression treatments.

Exploratory factor analyses generated a 2-factor solution: ethnic society immersion and dominant society immersion. Item refinement resulted in a 32-item version of the SMAS. Findings indicated a robust factor structure across groups. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the 2-factor model provided a close approximation to the observed data.

Methods: Chinese-American male (n = 17) youth smokers, aged 14-19 years, were recruited from community-based Asian-American organizations in the Delaware Valley Region of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. A 36-item questionnaire was developed to measure smoking behavior, attitudes, and culturally related factors. Focus groups were conducted. Cultural themes were addressed, such as interdependency and collective orientation of the Asian culture, importance of harmony in Asian families, and culturally related factors for smoking initiation and maintenance. A pre-post quasi-experimental research design was used. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test to determine differences in the intervention and control groups in smoking behavior and the Chi-square test for differences in program characteristics. Results: Participants almost never read their native language, they disagreed that their friends would accept them more if they were nonsmokers, and they thought they smoked because of high parental expectations. Asian teens perceived that a high percentage of their Asian-American peers smoke. The most important facilitator characteristics, program processes, relevant cultural factors and topics were identified for the program. Two groups were compared, a standard smoking cessation curriculum (SC) and a culturally modified program (ACT) for Asian adolescents. A 23.1% quit rate for the SC program and an 18.2% quit rate for the ACT program at 3-month follow-up was achieved. Among participants who continued to smoke, there was a larger reduction in reported weekend and weekday cigarette use among ACT participants, than the Standard (SC) group. There was a reduction of 6.7 cigarettes on a typical weekday and 6 cigarettes on a typical weekend day for ongoing smokers of the ACT group. Conclusions: Given the positive results among a high-risk population, the ACT program needs to be tested among a larger population of Chinese-Americans.

The message concepts, which were tailored specifically for Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants, used themes that were consistent with the cultural values of each group as expressed in the focus groups, yet also reflected the fact that, in many ways, these immigrants are seeking to adapt to American norms. The authors suggest that it is possible to construct culturally appropriate health education materials for recent immigrant populations rather than rely on simple translations of English-language materials. An intervention study using these message concepts is needed.

The study focuses on 390 native Filipino, immigrant Filipino, and U.S. born Filipino American undergraduate students. Early research on acculturation has assumed that as people become acculturated to their host cultures, their own culture of origin weakens. Whether a group's cultural values and attitudes change may be tied to acculturation. For example, research has found that gender role expectations are associated with changes in core cultural values. Thus, this study utilizes the Attitudes Towards Women's scale to measure changes in cultural values. Changes in values due to acculturation may affect family dynamics, including family conflict, within this population. This study revealed that Filipinos do not follow the typical acculturation framework wherein the longer a group is in the host country the more acculturated they become. This study found that although native Filipinos did have the most conservative attitudes towards women, that immigrant Filipinos had the most egalitarian, even more so than U.S. born Filipino Americans who were expected to have the highest scores, because of their higher level of acculturation. The findings suggest that acculturation may not exhibit a clear linear progression as presented in past literature.

For cross-cultural validation of our hypothesis, we assessed the relationship between chronic levels of FOI and dialectical reasoning in Koreans. Consistent with our proposal, both experimentally primed FOI (Experiment 1A and 2) and chronic levels of FOI (Experiment 1B) were positively related to relative preference for dialectical proverbs.

Using the data reported in the literature, our previous pilot study showed that the Japanese interpreted many emotional expressions differently from US viewers of the same emotions. In order to explore such discrepancies further, we conducted the same experiments on Chinese Ss (aged 20-37 yrs) residing in Beijing. The data showed that, similar to the Japanese viewers, Chinese viewers also judged many static facial emotional expressions differently from US viewers.

B. Hays et al., 1993). However, disclosure can also result in rejection, discrimination, and stigma, making the decision to disclose a dilemma for individuals infected with HIV. This decision may be particularly difficult for Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI) women, owing to HIV's association with topics considered 'taboo' in Asian cultures (T. S. Gock, 1994; G. Yep, 1993). This study explored the process, influencing factors, and consequences of disclosure among a sample of 9 HIV-positive A/PI women. On the basis of qualitative interviews and quantitative social network data, findings suggest that these women are acutely aware of and affected by the stigma attached to HIV and that the decision to disclose is influenced by fears about being stigmatized, concerns about disappointing or burdening others, and concerns about discrimination. The consequences of disclosure were generally positive, with variations over time that include both the exacerbation and amelioration of stress. Results suggest the need for research and interventions to address the cultural factors that affect the disclosure process as well as the varying levels and sources of stress over time.

The goal of the present study is to explore why different cultural groups respond differently to PPIs. Specifically, we examined responsiveness to PPIs in three cultural groups—Anglo-American, Asian American, and Indian (living in India)—both quantitatively and qualitatively. Participants (n = 469) were recruited and participated in the study via Amazon Mechanical Turk and were randomly assigned to a 15-min writing task focused on gratitude, optimism, or daily activities (control). As expected, we observed a culture by condition interaction whereby Anglo-Americans experienced increases in positive emotion with both gratitude and optimism tasks, but Indian participants experienced increases in both positive emotion and negative emotion when practicing gratitude, but not optimism. Qualitative analyses revealed possible causes for variability in success of PPIs in different cultures, and suggest possible adjustments that could be made to improve their efficacy. In summary, we observed differences in response to gratitude, but not optimism, which may be fueled by an adverse affective response among non-Anglo-American participants—Gratitude makes them feel good, but also sad and guilty.

Methods: We analyzed data from the 2002 to 2003 National Latino and Asian American Study (n = 1956). Regression models tested whether reports of racial discrimination were associated with BMI and obesity, after accounting for weight discrimination, age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, generation, employment, health status, and social desirability bias (the tendency to seek approval by providing the most socially desirable response to a question). Results: We found that (1) racial discrimination was associated with increased BMI and obesity after we controlled for weight discrimination, social desirability bias, and other factors and (2) the association between racial discrimination and BMI strengthened with increasing time in the United States.

Little is known about disability in older immigrants to the USA. Objective: To synthesize the evidence on the prevalence and factors associated with disability in older adult immigrants.Methods: We conducted searches in PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Scopus. Disability was defined as difficulty in performing basic or instrumental activities of daily living. Older adult was defined as 65 years and older. Immigrant status was defined as someone born outside of the USA. Results: Eighteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Seven studied Hispanic/Latino immigrants, six studied Asian immigrants, four studied diverse older immigrant samples, and one studied European immigrants. Prevalence of disability ranged from 2 to 49% in Asians and 3 to 58.1% in Hispanic/Latinos. In a diverse sample of immigrants, the prevalence of disability was 19.3%. Correlates of disability included female gender, low income, limited education, single status, migration in late adulthood, obesity, arthritis, and diabetes. Factors protective against disability in older adult immigrants were acculturation, migrating at a younger age, exercise, alcohol intake, and church attendance. Conclusion: Disability prevalence was generally lower in Asian immigrants compared to Hispanic/Latino immigrants. Identification of the precise rates and factors associated with disability in older immigrants can inform health interventions for this population.

This paper employs a critical analysis of media images of White women adorned in the symbols of Indian femininity to explore the circulating economy of seeing and representation. The theoretical intervention offered here turns on the notion of the Third Eye--the potential for the object of ethnographic spectacle to return the gaze. The analysis reveals that the contemporary 'ethnic chic' preserves power hierarchies by locating the White woman as sexual object, and the Indian woman as the disembodied fetish that supports White female sexuality. The implications for South Asian American women include the need to re-imagine sexuality with reference to critical race theory and the potential to return an oppositional gaze.

Associations between child adjustment and parents’ shaming and critically comparing children to their peers were also investigated. Design: Sixth-, seventh-and eighth-graders (Mages = 11.73, 12.74, and 13.78 years, respectively) residing in Shanghai (n = 150) and Chicago (n = 168) rated possible motivations for coercive authority assertion, indicated whether they approved of it, and reported their parents’ coercive authority assertion, critical comparison and shaming, as well as their own depression, antisocial behavior, and school effort. Results: Children in both cultures indicated that parents practiced coercive authority assertion to benefit their children more than themselves. Yet approval ratings were low. Approval of coercive authority assertion and the child-beneficial interpretation moderated relations between parents’ coercive authority assertion and depression in both cultures. For American children, relations between parents’ coercive authority assertion and both antisocial behavior and school effort were moderated by a social conventional interpretation. Critical comparison and shaming, and parents’ coercive authority assertion were associated with poorer adjustment in both cultures. Conclusions: Chinese and American children believe parents are well-meaning but misguided in their practice of coercive authority assertion. Children’s approval and interpretations can moderate parents’ coercive authority assertion’s links to psychosocial and academic functioning. Critical comparison and shaming is also associated with poorer adjustment in both cultures.

Cultural psychologists discuss this cultural variation in affective emotional context under the rubric of holistic vs. analytic thought, independent vs. interdependent self-construals, and socially disengaged vs. socially engaged emotion (e.g., Mesquita and Markus, 2004). We demonstrate that this effect is generalizable even when (1) photos of real facial emotions are used, (2) the saliency of the target model's emotion is attenuated, and (3) a specific amount of observation time is allocated.

For example, an individual may self-identify as White, but be perceived by most others as non-White. Documenting racial contestation is important because racialized experiences are shaped not only by the racial classification that individuals claim for themselves but also the external racial attributions placed on them by others. Focusing solely on monoracial identifying adults, this study answers three key questions about racial contestation: (a) How common is it? (b) Who is most likely to report experiencing it? and (c) How is it related to aspects of racial identity such as racial awareness, racial group closeness, and racial identity salience? Employing the 2006 Portraits of American Life Study, results suggest that reports of racial contestation among monoracial identifying adults are more common than some studies suggest (6% to 14%)—particularly among the fastest growing racial groups in the United States, including Latina/os and Asians—and that experiences of racial contestation are often associated with immigrant generation, ancestry, and phenotypical characteristics. Ordinal logistic regression analyses indicate that individuals who report experiencing racial contestation are no more aware of race in everyday life than other U.S. adults, but they feel less close to other members of the self-identified racial group and report lower levels of racial identity salience than their noncontested counterparts. These results point to a thinning of racial identity among the racially contested.

Most South Asian cultures are traditional and patriarchal, with religion, culture, and family playing significant and positive roles in the lives of South Asian women. South Asian cultural institutions often do not specifically respond to the needs of women. Divorce is related to family honor to such an extent that family members often pressure women to remain in abusive marriages. Though women are encouraged to pursue an education, reasons usually include honor to parents. It is concluded that community acceptance of the existence of domestic violence will do much to lessen its impact.

Two questions were addressed: (1) Do adolescents in Taiwan and in the United States differ in their willingness to help peer victims, and/or in the endorsement of specific help and non-help behaviors when assessed with a vignette? And (2) do adolescents in Taiwan respond and reason about their responses in the same way as do U.S. early adolescents when they witness real-life victimization? Four-hundred seventy U.S. 6th graders attending three public middle schools within the Midwest United States and 731 Taiwanese 7th graders from one middle school in southern Taiwan completed a survey that contained both open-ended questions asking about real-life reports of witnessing peer victimization and a vignette assessing responses to a hypothetical victimization event. Similarities and differences were found in witness responses from adolescents in the two cultural groups. Taiwanese adolescents were more likely to offer comfort to the victim and U.S. adolescents more likely to tell the bully to stop. Cultural values of interdependence versus independence were reflected in the reasons behind witness responses. Suggestions regarding how anti-victimization intervention and prevention programs should be tailored when they are introduced across the two cultural contexts are discussed.

However, scant availability of well-controlled emotional face stimuli from non-Western populations limit the evaluation of cultural differences in face emotion perception and how this might be modulated by age and sex differences. We present a database of East Asian face expression stimuli, enacted by young and older, male and female, Taiwanese using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Combined with a prior database, this present database consists of 90 identities with happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, surprised and neutral expressions amounting to 628 photographs. Twenty young and 24 older East Asian raters scored the photographs for intensities of multiple-dimensions of emotions and induced affect. Multivariate analyses characterized the dimensionality of perceived emotions and quantified effects of age and sex. We also applied commercial software to extract computer-based metrics of emotions in photographs. Taiwanese raters perceived happy faces as one category, sad, angry, and disgusted expressions as one category, and fearful and surprised expressions as one category. Younger females were more sensitive to face emotions than younger males. Whereas, older males showed reduced face emotion sensitivity, older female sensitivity was similar or accentuated relative to young females. Commercial software dissociated six emotions according to the FACS demonstrating that defining visual features were present. Our findings show that East Asians perceive a different dimensionality of emotions than Western-based definitions in face recognition software, regardless of age and sex. Critically, stimuli with detailed cultural norms are indispensable in interpreting neural and behavioral responses involving human facial expression processing. To this end, we add to the tools, which are available upon request, for conducting such research.

We expected that, when culturally appropriate scales were employed, Americans would not show higher control beliefs than Asians. Hypotheses were partially confirmed that Americans would be lower than Chinese (Hong Kong and PR China) on these new scales. It is suggested that views of Asians as passive avoiders of control at work may be incorrect and due to the overlooking of socioinstrumental control.

For instance, relations between (a) nonacceptance of emotions and BPD affect instability, (b) limited access to ER strategies and BPD identity disturbance, and (c) low emotional awareness and BPD diagnosis were stronger among White (vs. Black or East Asian) participants.

We used the Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adolescents (QOLQA) to examine ethnic differences in reported QOL scores among Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnicities in Singapore. Methods: The 70-item QOLQA measuring five QOL domains (physical, psychological, independence, social and environmental) was administered to a random sample of 1363 school-children aged 10-15 years, representative of the ethnic composition of Singapore adolescents (Chinese 72%, Malays 20% and Indians 8%). Results: Indians reported the highest overall QOL (mean 3.71 ± SD 0.54) compared to Chinese (3.59 ± 0.43), p < 0.05, and Malays (3.58 ± 0.44), p < 0.05.

The author further argues to conceptually differentiate identification with the majority group and identification with the larger society. A study with Asian American students (n = 91) and African American students (n = 115) in a large US Midwestern public university revealed no correlation between ethnic identity and identification with White Americans for Asian Americans and a small negative correlation at marginal significance for African Americans. These results support the orthogonal model. While identification with White Americans positively predicted national identity in regression analyses for both samples, ethnic identity also added a unique positive main effect, and additionally through an interaction effect suppressed the strength of identification with White Americans, for predicting national identity among American-born Asian Americans. Bicultural identity integrating ethnicity and nationality was suggested as the identity mechanism explaining this result. Thus, identification with the majority group and national identity were empirically shown to be different concepts, and ethnic identity can contribute to national identity. Suggestions for future research include regional comparative studies and deeper analysis of bicultural integration.

Following self-categorization theory, different predictions were tested and supported. Self-ratings on trait adjectives systematically, differed between an intragroup (Chinese) and an intergroup (Chinese vs Dutch) context. Furthermore, ethnic self-categorization turned out to be related to self-descriptions in the intragroup context, whereas ethnic self-esteem showed an effect on self-descriptions in the intergroup context. Acculturation attitudes and ingroup favouritism were also affected by the comparative context. In the intergroup context, participants were more strongly in favour of heritage culture maintenance and reported higher ingroup favouritism than in the intragroup context.

The examination of group differences was interpreted based on variations across ethnicities in norms concerning emotional expression and gender roles. Overall, gender stereotypes of emotion were evident among all ethnic groups studied, but European Americans' gender stereotypes were the most gender differentiated. For example, European American stereotypes held that men express more pride than women do, but African Americans' stereotypes of pride for men and women did not differ. Similarly, whereas among European Americans, women were stereotyped to express much more love than men do, the gender difference was smaller among Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans. These different norms may pose challenges for inter-cultural interactions, and they point to the importance of considering both gender and ethnicity simultaneously in the study of emotions.

In an exhaustive review of the literature, we found that depressed Asian-American youth were four times more likely to display suicidal behavior when compared to other Asian youths with other diagnoses; and depressed African-American females were more likely to report suicidal ideation than male adolescents. We also found that Asian-Americans who experience high parental conflict are 30 times more likely to engage in suicidal behavior when compared to Asian-American youths with low parental conflict. African-American adolescents are 6.4 times more likely to attempt suicide as a result of parental conflict. With respect to alcohol use and dependence, Caucasian adolescents were twice as likely as the African American victims to have used alcohol before committing suicide. Alcohol use among adolescents was associated with increased suicidal behavior. Cultural differences in alcohol consumption may account for disparities, however future research is needed to further examine cultural trends in suicidal behavior and alcoholism.

Gobster (see record [rid]2007-10451-007[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2007-10451-006[/rid]). Gobster addresses several issues in our paper. These include, first, a suggestion that the measure of cultural values that we used is not appropriate for understanding possible variations in racial and ethnic patterns of outdoor leisure preferences and behavior. Second, Gobster questions our concern with the use of common racial and ethnic labels because these are part and parcel of the way in which people look at others. Third, grouping people by racial and ethnic labels has often contributed to social justice. Fourth, ethnic groups in the U.S. are growing and what may have been small differences between groups in the past may be magnified in the future due to these demographic shifts. Fifth, research is constrained by resources that limit sampling designs and, therefore, collapsing smaller ethnic and/or racial groups into larger ones may be required for statistical comparisons of adequate power to be made. Sixth, Gobster expresses concern over our use of cultural consensus analysis, a single method, in claiming that ethnicity may not be a useful concept. Finally, he mentions the problem with variance accounted for in studies of leisure participation, a concern that we expressed in our paper.

In particular, we are interested in the degree to which presumed ethnic groups exhibit internal cultural homogeneity. In 2002, the visitors to the Angeles National Forest (ANF) near metropolitan Los Angeles were surveyed. Using purposive sampling at sites known to be heavily used by visitors with diverse ethnic backgrounds, we obtained a sample of 444 Anglos, 312 Hispanics, and 319 Asians (overall n = 1,174). We examined whether the three nominal ethnic groups, Anglos, Hispanics, and Asians, were homogeneous in terms of cultural values as measured by Hofstede's (1980) instrument. We assume that if distinctive ethnic subcultures exist then they should be identifiable by specific measures of languages, religion, family structure, cultural values, and the like. We used cultural consensus analyses to test the homogeneity of the three ethnic groups. The results of cultural consensus analyses showed that none of the three ethnic groups and none of the subgroups we examined within the three ethnic groups were homogeneous in terms of the cultural values. Discussion of the findings and research implications are suggested.

Self-esteem was also found to be significantly negatively correlated with inmate distress. The main explanations for the findings centred around suggestions that separation from the family reduces ethnic identity in Asian inmates and thus results in a lowered ability to stave off attacks to self-esteem and hence adapt to custodial life, although caution was exercised in these explanations since no direct measure of ethnic identity was taken.

Both Asian American groups reported using more strategies of accepting responsibility, religious coping, distancing, and escape-avoidance than the Caucasian Americans did; the Filipino Americans also reported more problem-solving strategies than the Caucasian Americans. For all participants, challenge appraisals predicted adaptive coping (problem solving and positive reappraisal) and less distress.

The church was supportive to many Chinese because it offered a healing-redemptive fellowship concerned with spiritual and mental health; it also served as a substitute for the Chinese kinship network and acted as an arena for sociocultural change. Three strategies helped form a Chinese-Christian identity: the combining of the Chinese and Christian worlds, the promotion of a united church, and the minimization of personal conflicts. Rhetoric also tied together group and individual perspectives.

Ethnic-racial socialization has an indirect effect on self-esteem for Asian American emerging adults.,"Brown, Carrie M.; Ling, Wells",Psychology,21527180,,20120101,3,1,78,4,2012-29190-013,10.4236/psych.2012.31013,"Scientific Research Publishing, Inc.",Journal Article,Psychosocial Development; Racial and Ethnic Attitudes; Self-Esteem; Socialization; Asians; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female,,"Although there has been recognition of the importance of examining the indirect effect of perceived parental ethnic-racial socialization on youths’ psychosocial outcomes, few studies have done so. To date, Tran and Lee’s (2010) study is one of few that has linked ethnic-racial socialization to psychosocial outcomes among Asian Americans, specifically. The purpose of this study was to extend Tran and Lee’s (2010) research in two ways. First, the present study tested a model similar to Tran and Lee’s but replaced their dependent variable, social competence, with self-esteem. Second, the present study tested the model among Asian American emerging adults (i.e., ages 18 to 25), not late adolescents. The present study hypothesized that perceiving more frequent messages of cultural socialization-pluralism from parents would indirectly lead to higher self-esteem via stronger ethnic identity. One-hundred-fourteen self-identified Asian Americans (M age = 21.34 years; 66% female) completed an online survey that included measures of perceived cultural socialization-pluralism, ethnic identity, and self-esteem. Based on model testing via the bootstrap method (Preacher & Hayes, 2008), the hypothesis was supported. The findings of the present study contribute to the discussion of the role that perceived ethnic-racial socialization plays in Asian Americans’ positive development. Further, the present study contributes to the limited research on ethnicracial socialization among Asian Americans.

The objectives of this evaluation were to establish whether IPSAF had an immediate and medium‐term impact on those who attended and how it impacted on the wider family and the person with dementia. Methods: An inclusive, pluralistic approach was adopted. Seven focus groups were conducted with 42 participants, and 37 participated in a pre‐post knowledge quiz. Seven family interviews were conducted with 17 participants, and 3 families were followed up after 6 months. Thematic analysis was conducted on the data. Findings: The IPSAF was found to improve participants' knowledge of dementia leading to increased understanding of the person with dementia. Participants became more aware of available services and accessed services to make use of practical support. IPSAF was reported to have an impact for people living with dementia, with carers' newfound understanding resulting in some changes in care practice that promoted empowerment and independence for people living with dementia. There was also some evidence to suggest that IPSAF had an impact on the wider family, with participants sharing information about dementia with family members who had not attended the programme. Families were continuing to make changes to improve the lives of people living with dementia 6 months later, suggesting IPSAF had a sustained impact.

However, further cross-validations using other clinical measures and diverse samples from other cultures have not been advanced recently. We aimed to examine the validity of the DSSI hierarchical class model using both Korean non-patient and patient (schizophrenia and depression) groups. Method: The hypothesis of inclusive, non-reflexive relationships among the DSSI classes was tested. The power of DSSI to detect presence of symptoms was assessed via cross-validation with other clinical measures, and the differences between the clinical features among the DSSI classes were examined using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). Results: The high rate of model conformity (91.1%) across the samples and cross-validation with other criterion measures provided further support for the validity of DSSI. Conclusions: DSSI is a reliable self-report measure that can be applied to both patient and non-patients to assess the presence and severity of psychiatric illness. Future studies that include more diverse clinical groups are necessary to lend further support for its utility in clinical practice.

This research highlights the importance of the cultural meanings of self-expression and the moderating role of cultural beliefs on the psychological effect of self-expression.

The role of extracurricular involvement in the achievement and motivation of students from immigrant families was examined among 468 eleventh grade (52.4 % female) students from Asian American (44.4 %), European American (19.0 %) and Latino (36.5 %) backgrounds who varied in generational status (first: 25 %; second: 52.4 %, third: 22.6 %) and attended high school in the Los Angeles area. Participants completed questionnaires regarding their extracurricular activities, school belonging, and intrinsic motivation. Students’ grade point average (GPA) was obtained from official school records. Controls included parental education, ethnicity, generational status, gender, school, and the outcome variables in tenth grade. First generation students were less likely to participate in academic activities than their third generation peers but, overall, there were few generational differences in participation. Participation predicted achievement and engagement after accounting for tenth grade levels of educational adjustment. Most notably, although all students benefitted from participation, the gain in GPA as a function of participation was greater for first generation than third generation students. Results suggest that organized after-school activities are particularly important for students in immigrant families, providing them with additional experiences that contribute to academic achievement.

Furthermore, we hypothesized that familism would negatively impact the mental health of children of refugees but not that of children of immigrants. The study used data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS). A group of 491 Asian American refugee and 391 immigrant parents and their adolescent children served as the sample. As predicted, refugees were less acculturated than immigrants, which partially mediated the effect of migration type on their children's level of familism. Also, as predicted, familism negatively impacted the mental health of children of refugees but not that of children of immigrants.

Evidence indicates that familism is particularly relevant for U.S. Latinos but is also relevant for non-Latinos. Thus, we expected to observe the hypothesized pattern in Latinos and explored whether the pattern extended to non-Latinos of European and East Asian cultural background. A sample of U.S. participants of Latino (n = 140), European (n = 176), and East Asian (n = 199) cultural background currently in a romantic relationship completed measures of familism, attachment, and two indices of romantic relationship quality, namely, partner support and partner closeness. As predicted, higher familism was associated with higher partner support and partner closeness, and these associations were mediated by lower attachment avoidance in the Latino sample. This pattern was not observed in the European or East Asian background samples. The implications of familism for relationships and psychological processes relevant to relationships in Latinos and non-Latinos are discussed.

Though often portrayed as burdensome, there has been limited empirical research on how family assistance attitudes affect the mental health among diverse emerging adults. We examined the influence of various attitudes toward family assistance on family cultural conflict, a mental health risk factor. Results from our survey showed that second-generation Asian Americans (N = 328) rated family assistance as more important than nonimmigrant European American (N = 343) college students, and that this was partly explained by differences in interdependent self-construal. As predicted, higher levels of self-expectations of daily family assistance were associated with lower self-reported family cultural conflict among second-generation Asian Americans but not among native-born European Americans. Findings suggest that for second-generation Asian Americans who are emerging adults, an incongruency between self- and family expectations for assistance may be more predictive of mental health risk than for nonimmigrant European Americans.

There are four behavioral types that emerged from the data: expected contributors, unexpected contributors, expected noncontributors, and unexpected noncontributors. An analysis of the different types reveals that parental expectations—born from structural circumstances of economic need and ethnic cultural practices—influence respondents’ attitudes and behaviors toward fulfilling these financial family obligations.

It is argued that cognitive-behavioral, goal oriented family work can be adapted for immigrant Chinese families with a member suffering from schizophrenia. The case of one such family is described to demonstrate how the model of family work for schizophrenia can be applied to Chinese immigrant families.

Although CH and EA women reported experiencing similar levels of sadness, CH women experienced higher levels of somatic sensations (e.g., changes in heartbeat) relative to EA women.

A total of 330 Asian American college students from a West coast university participated in an online survey. Results from PROCESS supported hypotheses. First, self-reflection significantly moderated the effects of acculturative stress on ethnocultural empathy. Specifically, the effect of acculturative stress on ethnocultural empathy was significantly positive for those with lower self-reflection. Conversely, this effect was not significant for those with higher self-reflection, but ethnocultural empathy was consistently high across all levels of acculturative stress for those with higher self-reflection. Post hoc exploratory analyses examined the moderated mediation model using each of the 5 domains of acculturative stress as predictors; results supported the moderated mediation hypotheses for 2 domains, discrimination and cultural isolation. Second, self-reflection significantly moderated the indirect effects of acculturative stress on 2 positive outcomes through ethnocultural empathy. Results from conditional indirect effects suggested that the indirect effects of acculturative stress on 2 positive outcomes through ethnocultural empathy were significantly positive for those with lower self-reflection. Conversely, the indirect effects were not significant for those with higher self-reflection, but the 2 positive outcomes stayed high at all levels of acculturative stress.

The merchant-customer relationship has been cited as a catalyst to such conflicts as the 1992 Los Angeles riot, the boycotts of Korean-owned businesses, and the 1995 firebombing of a Jewish-owned store in New York's Harlem. These images of conflict that have been seared into the public consciousness, however are inconsistent with most merchant-customer interactions and does not reflect the full range of commercial life in black communities. Most merchant-customer interactions are civil and ordinary. Civil relations prevail because merchants foster civility, abate tensions, and thwart conflict. However under conditions of extreme inequality, small events can trigger racial anger and the symbolic significance of nonblack-owned businesses can become a stimulus of motivations for protest that leads to boycotts and firebombings.

A previous study showed that depression dampened negative emotional responses in European Americans, but increased these responses in Asian Americans (Chentsova-Dutton et al., 2007). These findings support the cultural norm hypothesis, which predicts that depression reduces individuals' abilities to react in culturally ideal ways (i.e., disrupting European Americans' abilities to express emotions openly and Asian Americans' abilities to moderate emotions). In the present study, we examined the generalizability of this hypothesis to positive emotion. We measured the emotional reactivity of 35 European Americans (17 depressed) and 31 Asian Americans (15 depressed) to an amusing film. Consistent with the cultural norm hypothesis, European Americans who were depressed showed dampened emotional reactivity (i.e., fewer smiles, less intense reports of positive emotion, lower cardiac activation) compared to control European Americans, whereas Asian Americans who were depressed showed similar (for smiles and reports of positive emotion), and even greater (for higher cardiac activation) emotional reactivity compared to control Asian Americans. These findings suggest that the cultural norm hypothesis generalizes to positive emotion.

This cross-cultural study attempts to bridge the gap in literature by providing an evaluation of the predictive ability of psychological variables such as gambling urge, gambling-related erroneous cognitions and comorbid alcohol consumption on pathological gambling behaviour and its impact on overall quality of life indicators. Participants consist of 445 Macao and Australian young adults (Mean age = 23 years). Results indicate that probable pathological gamblers as compared with non-gamblers reported significantly lower quality of life in all domains—physical health, psychological well-being, social relationships and environment. Adults who drank more alcohol and have stronger erroneous cognitions evidenced higher pathological gambling behavior. Our research model fits both cohorts and interestingly, erroneous gambling-related cognitions serve as a full mediator for the predictive relationship between gambling urge and pathological gambling in the Macao sample, but serve as a partial mediator in the Australian sample. Targeting erroneous cognitions in future social marketing or preventive campaigns should demonstrate to be an important strategy in reducing the effects of urge to gamble among at-risk individuals. Further implications for the industry, marketing and governmental strategies are discussed.

Gender differences in adolescent premarital sexual permissiveness in three Asian cities: Effects of gender-role attitudes.,"Zuo, Xiayun; Lou, Chaohua; Gao, Ersheng; Cheng, Yan; Niu, Hongfeng; Zabin, Laurie S.",Journal of Adolescent Health,1054139X,,20120301,50,"3, Suppl",S18,8,2012-04818-006,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.12.001,Elsevier Science,Journal Article,Human Sex Differences; Premarital Intercourse; Sex Roles; Sexual Attitudes; Reproductive Health; Asians; Cross Cultural Differences; Urban Environments; Adolescence (13-17 yrs); Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Male; Female,,"Purpose: Gender is an important factor in understanding premarital sexual attitudes and behaviors. Many studies indicate that males are more likely to initiate sexual intercourse and have more permissive perceptions about sex than females. Yet few studies have explored possible reasons for these gender differences. With samples of unmarried adolescents in three Asian cities influenced by Confucian cultures, this article investigates the relationship between underlying gender norms and these differences in adolescents’ premarital sexual permissiveness (PSP). Methods: In a collaborative survey conducted in 2006–2007 in urban and rural areas of Hanoi, Shanghai, and Taipei, 16,554 unmarried participants aged 15–24 years were recruited in the three-City Asian Study of Adolescents and Youth, with 6,204, 6,023, and 4,327 respondents from each city, respectively. All the adolescents were administered face-to-face interviews, coupled with computer-assisted self-interview for sensitive questions. Scales on gender-role attitudes and on PSP for both male and female respondents were developed and applied to our analysis of the data. Multilinear regression was used to analyze the relationship between gender-role attitudes and sexual permissiveness. Results: Male respondents in each city held more permissive attitudes toward premarital sex than did females, with both boys and girls expressing greater permissiveness to male premarital sexual behaviors. Boys also expressed more traditional attitudes to gender roles (condoning greater inequality) than did girls in each city. Adolescents’ gender-role attitudes and permissiveness to premarital sex varied considerably across the three cities, with the Vietnamese the most traditional, the Taiwanese the least traditional, and the adolescents in Shanghai in the middle. A negative association between traditional gender roles and PSP was only found among girls in Shanghai and Taipei. In Shanghai, female respondents who held more traditional gender-role attitudes were more likely to exercise a double standard with respect to male as opposed to female premarital sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.18). This relationship also applied to attitudes of both girls and boys in Taipei (OR = 1.20 and OR = 1.22, respectively). Conclusions: Although with variation across sites, gender differences in PSP and attitudes to gender roles among adolescents were very significant in each of the three Asian cities influenced by Confucian-based values. Traditional gender norms may still be deeply rooted in the three cities, especially among females; while it is important to advocate gender equity in adolescent reproductive health programs, the pathway of traditional gender norms in influencing adolescent reproductive health outcomes must be understood, as must differences and similarities across regions.

A number of studies investigating gendered race stereotypes have found that Blacks in North American society are represented and conceived as prototypically masculine, while Asians are represented and conceived of as prototypically feminine. This study examined whether patterns consistent with gendered race prototypes appear in mass media depictions, specifically in popular magazines, such that Asian men and Black women are proportionally less likely than other groups to be depicted. The perceived race and gender of 8,672 individuals depicted within 5 issues each of 6 popular magazines were examined quantitatively to examine whether individuals from nonprototypical gendered race categories were less likely to be depicted. The results indicated that Asian women were more likely to be depicted than Asian men, while Black men were more likely to be depicted than Black women, relative to Whites. These results suggest that, consistent with theories of gendered race and intersectional invisibility, individuals deemed less prototypical of their race and gender categories are rendered invisible in societal representations.

Two initial studies captured the explicit and implicit gender content of racial stereotypes: Compared with the White stereotype, the Asian stereotype was more feminine, whereas the Black stereotype was more masculine. Study 3 found that heterosexual White men had a romantic preference for Asians over Blacks and that heterosexual White women had a romantic preference for Blacks over Asians; preferences for masculinity versus femininity mediated participants’ attraction to Blacks relative to Asians. The pattern of romantic preferences observed in Study 3 was replicated in Study 4, an analysis of the data on interracial marriages from the 2000 U.S. Census. Study 5 showed that Blacks were more likely and Asians less likely than Whites to be selected for a masculine leadership position. In Study 6, an analysis of college athletics showed that Blacks were more heavily represented in more masculine sports, relative to Asians.

We find that white men are more willing than white women to date non-whites in general, yet, with the exception of their top two preferences for dates, whites and Latinos, the racial hierarchies of males and females differ. Among daters with stated racial preferences, white men are more likely to exclude blacks as possible dates, while white women are more likely to exclude Asians.

The results of empirical analysis using the 2006 Chicago Council on Global Affairs-East Asia Institute survey on public perceptions of international relations indicate that both the economic and cultural approaches help explain variations in public preferences for regional economic integration in East Asia. Korean citizens with a positive view of economic globalization or higher levels of cultural tolerance tend to support Northeast Asian economic integration. Furthermore, the results find that perceived security threats from Japan hinder the support for regional economic integration, whereas perceptions of increasing fair trade with China and anti-Americanism increase public support.

It is argued that East Asian (and especially Chinese) societies are anchored in an indigenous form of hierarchical relationalism where social structure is produced by relational obligations of an ethical and normative nature that have slowed its traditional culture 'melting into air' as prophesied by Marx. The successfully modernization of East Asia has involved hybridization, compartmentalization, and sequencing of traditional psychological features of Confucianist societies such as delay of gratification and respect for education, paternalistic leadership, filial piety, and beliefs in harmony or benevolence. Features of hierarchical relationalism are adaptable to creating niches for East Asian societies that thrive under globalization as characterized by the paradoxical coupling of economic inequality in fact with discourses of equality in principle. Moral, ethical demands for enlightened leadership constrain East Asian elites to at least attempt to protect subordinates and protect societal (rather than merely individual or familial) well‐being. A fundamental contribution of East Asia to global society may be in the articulation of how to ameliorate economic inequality using Confucian principles of hierarchical relationalism.

We examined the extent to which status quo supporting beliefs (social dominance orientation and conservatism) were associated with negative attitudes toward African Americans and whether the strength of the relationship varied between members of higher and lower status racial groups. On explicit and implicit measures, status quo supporting beliefs were associated with negative attitudes toward African Americans among members of higher (White) and lower status (Black, Hispanic, and Asian) racial groups. The association was stronger among Whites than racial minorities and was stronger among Asians and Latinos than Blacks. Status quo supporting beliefs are associated with negative attitudes toward lower status groups regardless of one’s group status, but the strength of the association is greatest among the societally advantaged.

Driven by the combined forces of rapid gross domestic product growth in many Asian economies and their further integration into the global business arena, firms in Asia are in constant flux, no matter whether they are developed economies like Japan, Korea, and Taiwan; developing economies like Malaysia and Thailand; or transitional economies like China and Vietnam. How will HRM systems in these countries evolve and transform under the combined forces of growth and globalization? We argue that HRM systems in these Asian firms most likely will evolve toward 'bounded convergence.' The demands and expectations of the HR function to take on strategic roles (versus administrative roles) and address critical HR issues like attracting and retaining key talent, building talent pipelines, and creating high-performing cultures are greater than ever. We conclude with a high-level summary of the key contribution of the eight articles covered in this Special Issue.

This study examines what factors are most closely associated with literacy competence by inspecting Korean heritage learners’ language and literacy practice patterns and their literacy performance. Using language background surveys and Korean writing samples gathered from 56 Korean-English bilingual students in grades 4–12 and university undergraduates, it was discovered that participants’ levels of Korean literacy were positively associated with home Korean language use and focused Korean language practice, whereas they were negatively correlated with years of US stay, years of schooling in the USA, and home English language use. A regression analysis revealed that the quality and range of HL practice was the only significant predictor of HL literacy skills. In addition, a one-way ANOVA indicated no significant difference for HL writing scores across four age groups (i.e. elementary school, middle school, high school, and college), which implies that HL literacy does not necessarily develop or accumulate with cognitive maturity or length of schooling, a finding dissimilar to conventional native language and literacy development.

"HIV among female sex workers in the Central Asian Republics, Afghanistan, and Mongolia: Contexts and convergence with drug use.","Baral, Stefan; Todd, Catherine S.; Aumakhan, Bulbul; Lloyd, Jennifer; Delegchoimbol, Altanchimeg; Sabin, Keith",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,03768716,,20131101,132,Suppl 1,S13,4,2013-29596-001,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2013.07.004,Elsevier Science,Journal Article,Drug Abuse; HIV; Injections; Prostitution; Sexual Risk Taking; Asians; Human Females; Risk Factors; Female,,"Background: Central Asia is culturally and demographically diverse, both between and within its respective countries. That diversity is represented in the range of individual, network, community, and structural risks for female sex workers (FSWs) regionally. FSWs have several risk factors for HIV acquisition and transmission including behavioral, biological, and structural risk factors. Across Central Asia, sexual risks have become conflated with risks associated with injection and non-injection illicit drug use. Methods: Peer-reviewed literature databases and gray literature were searched for articles on sex work in Central Asia. The medial subject heading (MeSH) of 'sex work' was cross-referenced with terms associated with Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Afghanistan. Results: HIV prevalence data for FSWs suggest sustained or increasing prevalence in the region. There are increasing data directly linking HIV among FSWs to injection drug use; odds of HIV are up to 20 times higher among FSWs reporting injecting drug use. Though injecting drug use among FSWs is rare in some settings, recreational drugs and alcohol use limits other risk reduction behaviors, such as condom use. Conclusions: The Central Asian HIV epidemic has traditionally been assumed to be driven nearly exclusively by drug use, resulting in surveillance systems focused on parenteral transmission. The reviewed data highlight limited attention to characterizing the burden of HIV and risk factors for HIV acquisition and transmission among FSWs who use drugs. Moving forward will require enhanced HIV surveillance and research to inform HIV prevention approaches to address all levels of HIV risks affecting FSWs in Central Asia.

G. Morton and others supported a 'Caucasoid > Mongoloid > Negroid' hierarchy of intelligence. This continued through most of the 20th century but was challenged by a nonhierarchical view originating with F. Boas. Beginning in the 1980s J. P. Rushton correlated cranial and IQ measurements and presented a hierarchy with 'Mongoloids' at the top. Each of these periods relates to its social context: the 19th-century hierarchy paralleled the height of European world domination; the nonhierarchy of the 20th century reflected world wars, worldwide depression, and the breakup of empires; the 'M > C > N' hierarchy followed the economic success of several Asian nations. A critique of Rushton's use of the race concept, his aggregation of diverse populations into 3 traditional races, his claim to explain differences in 'cultural achievements' on the basis of variation in brain size, and a number of other problems is analyzed to explain Rushton's support for the M > C > N ordering. The study concludes by noting that the major consequence of these hierarchies is the apparent justification for the exploitation of those at the bottom.

We show that this cultural difference does not reflect better integration of social information during language processing, but rather is the result of differential correction: in the earliest moments of referential processing, Chinese participants showed equivalent egocentric interference to Westerners, but managed to suppress the interference earlier and more effectively. A time-series analysis of visual-world eye-tracking data found that the two cultural groups diverged extremely late in processing, between 600 and 1400 ms after the onset of egocentric interference. We suggest that the early moments of referential processing reflect the operation of a universal stratum of processing that provides rapid ambiguity resolution at the cost of accuracy and flexibility. Late components, in contrast, reflect the mapping of outputs from referential processes to decision-making and action planning systems, allowing for a flexibility in responding that is molded by culturally specific demands.

Methods: Retrospective, population-based data were collected by the Vital Statistics branch of the California Department of Health Services. Approximately 2.6 million records of all live California births with a birth certificate in 2000–2004 were included. Analysis focused on prenatal care receipt and population characteristics associated with lack of adequate prenatal care, especially among Asian and Pacific Islander groups. Results: Pacific Islanders (n = 11,962) were the most likely, compared to any other racial/ethnic group, to have inadequate prenatal care (OR = 2.9, 95% CIs 2.8–3.1), even when controlling for factors known to affect care receipt, specifically maternal age, educational attainment, parity, insurance, geographical region of residence, and maternal place of birth. In contrast, Asian women (n = 295,741) received care closer to that of the White reference group (OR = 1.5, 95% CIs 1.5–1.5). Among Pacific Islanders, Samoans (OR = 3.0, 95% CIs 2.7–3.4) were at particular risk of inadequate care compared to other PI sub-groups. Conclusion: Pacific Islander women received less adequate prenatal care than women of other racial/ethnic groups. The common practice of combining Asians and Pacific Islanders into a single A/PI category may mask needs in the Pacific Islander community. Therefore, in order to continue to reduce health disparities, it may be necessary to collect separate data on these two distinct populations in order to be able to appropriately direct programs and resources.

One may argue that individualistic informed consent, for example, is not compatible with the Asian communitarian orientation. But this normative claim uses an empirical assumption that may be contrary to the fact that some Asians do value and argue for informed consent. Is it necessary and factual to neatly characterize some cultures as individualistic and some as communitarian? Empirical investigation can provide a reasonable way to inform such generalizations. In a multi-cultural context, such as in the Philippines, there is a need to investigate the nature of the local ethos before making any appeal to authenticity. Otherwise we may succumb to the same ethical imperialism we are trying hard to resist. Normative claims that involve empirical premises cannot be reasonably verified or evaluated without utilizing empirical methods along with philosophical reflection. The integration of empirical methods to the standard normative approach to moral reasoning should be reasonably guided by the epistemic demands of claims arising from cross-cultural discourse in bioethics.

On summary scales representing traditional prejudice, opposition to race-targeting, and policy-related beliefs, White negativity swells as the local Black population share expands. Among non-Southern Whites, a 10-point rise in the local percentage of Blacks brings an increase in traditional prejudice greater than the decrease in prejudice that comes with three additional years of education. South/non-South differences in Whites' views about Blacks are generally reduced to about one-half of their original size and fall short of statistical significance when local racial composition is controlled. Interestingly, concentrations of local Asian American and Latino populations do not engender White antipathy toward these groups.

A total of 26 Asian American women participated in qualitative focus groups of four to six individuals each from December 2015 to February 2016. Constructivist grounded theory was used to analyze focus group data. The resulting theoretical model, the 'Asian American body image evolutionary model,' maintains that a central phenomenon of perceptions and interpretation of messages about body image and eating is rooted in three influencing factors: (a) societal influence of mainstream White culture and Asian culture, (b) interpersonal influences of immediate family and close others, and (c) individual influence. An individual’s perceptions and subsequent interpretation of messages may lead to disordered eating and decisions around treatment seeking. The model developed can be utilized by practitioners or clinicians to help obtain a better understanding of the societal, interpersonal, and intrapersonal forces that may shape conceptualizations about body image and eating behaviors among Asian American women.

To illustrate these points, I compare American and East Asian cultures, which differ in their valuation of high-arousal positive affective states (e.g., excitement, enthusiasm) and low-arousal positive affective states (e.g., calm, peacefulness). I then introduce affect valuation theory, which integrates ideal affect with current models of affect and emotion and, in doing so, provides a new framework for understanding how cultural and temperamental factors may shape affect and behavior.

This is in direct contrast to cricket, where large numbers choose to follow a team from the Indian subcontinent.

Method: Study 1 (N = 180; 61% male) LPRs have a mean age of M = 30.78, SD = 8.25. Participants completed a survey. Sixty-seven participants indicated their country of birth as a Central/South American or Caribbean country, 40 as a European country, 44 as an Asian country, 16 as a Southeast Asian or Middle Eastern country, and 13 as an African country. Study 2 (N = 218; 56% male) LPRs have a mean age of M = 30.33, SD = 8.37. Participants completed an experiment. Eighty-three participants indicated their country of birth as a Central/South American or Caribbean country, 55 as a European country, 37 as a Southeast Asian or Middle Eastern country, 31 as an Asian country, and 12 as an African country. Results: Study 1 demonstrates that identity concerns, above and beyond perceived realistic concerns, are significantly related to motivation to naturalize. In particular, perception of belonging to the U.S. is positively related to a motivation to naturalize. Moreover, we test a theory-driven model such that higher perceptions of subgroup respect are positively related to a sense of U.S. belonging which, in turn, predicts a motivation to naturalize. Study 2 extends the previous study by manipulating subgroup respect and demonstrating that this affects a sense of belonging to the U.S. which, in turn, predicts a stronger motivation to naturalize. Conclusions: We discuss the implications of the present work for theory and the social issue of naturalization and citizenship.

Among highly interdependent individuals, positive emotion expressivity was associated with greater daily positive mood, lower trait interpersonal problems, and lower depressive symptoms; however, this was not shown for low interdependence individuals.

Simple ingroup bias was the more common type among a General Social Survey (GSS) national probability sample of 1,119 non-Jewish Whites who rated Jews, Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics on five traits. The two types appear to represent different points on an ethnocentrism continuum; thus, researchers who do not distinguish between them may underestimate the possible impact of ethnocentrism. The generally low levels of classic ethnocentrism did increase for people low in education or high in authoritarianism or social distance. The research also tested an ethnocentrism typology. Many respondents fell into two nonclassic ethnocentrism categories: positivity (where own-group and other-group ratings are both favorable) and neutral matching.

Some perceptual operations, such as initial eye movements to faces, are critical for extraction of information supporting evolutionarily important tasks such as face identification. The extent of cultural effects on these crucial perceptual processes is unknown. Here, we report that the first gaze location for face identification was similar across East Asian and Western Caucasian cultural groups: Both fixated a featureless point between the eyes and the nose, with smaller between-group than within-group differences and with a small horizontal difference across cultures (8% of the interocular distance). We also show that individuals of both cultural groups initially fixated at a slightly higher point on Asian faces than on Caucasian faces. The initial fixations were found to be both fundamental in acquiring the majority of information for face identification and optimal, as accuracy deteriorated when observers held their gaze away from their preferred fixations. An ideal observer that integrated facial information with the human visual system’s varying spatial resolution across the visual field showed a similar information distribution across faces of both races and predicted initial human fixations. The model consistently replicated the small vertical difference between human fixations to Asian and Caucasian faces but did not predict the small horizontal leftward bias of Caucasian observers. Together, the results suggest that initial eye movements during face identification may be driven by brain mechanisms aimed at maximizing accuracy, and less influenced by culture. The findings increase our understanding of the interplay between the brain’s aims to optimally accomplish basic perceptual functions and to respond to sociocultural influences.

The Cultural Theory and Model of Suicide (Chu, Goldblum, Floyd, & Bongar, 2010) was one of the first comprehensive efforts to provide a framework that guides an understanding of how culture influences suicide risk across multiple cultural identities. The Cultural Assessment of Risk for Suicide (CARS), a 39-item self-report measure assessing culturally specific suicide risk factors, was developed based on the Cultural Theory and Model of Suicide. These theoretical and measurement works, although foundational in their importance for synthesizing a broad literature, have not been tested and translated into applied clinical practice. The current case study is a translational effort that applies these approaches to culturally competent suicide practice with 'Zoe,' an Asian American veteran trans woman in her early thirties with moderate-high suicide risk. Application of the Cultural Theory and Model of Suicide and the CARS illuminated cultural risk factors that were not considered in Zoe’s original safety plan (e.g., family conflict, minority stress; hidden suicidal ideation and behaviors; and cultural expressions of suicidal distress as anger, fatigue, and shame). These results yielded differences in Zoe’s risk management plan and created a culturally informed approach that corresponded with a concomitant decrease in suicidal symptoms. This study demonstrated that the CARS may detect alternative cultural expressions of suicidal distress and behaviors and yield important implications for suicide risk assessment and management planning for culturally diverse clients.

Background: To alleviate the nursing shortage, healthcare institutions have increased recruitment of nurses internationally, with Asian nurses representing the largest proportion of international nurses working in the US. Whilst organisational commitment and perception of practice environment were related to intention to leave, few studies have been done on the predictability of intention to leave amongst Asian nurses. Design: A cross‐sectional postal survey design. Method: One hundred and ninety‐five Asian nurses working at least six months in US hospitals completed the survey. Most participants were Filipinos or Chinese, married and worked full‐time. The Organisational Commitment Questionnaire, Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index, Anticipated Turnover Scale and Collectivist Orientation Scale with satisfactory reliability were used. Results: Perception of practice environment was correlated with intention to leave and organisational commitment, which was correlated with intention to leave. Cultural orientation showed positive predictable effects on organisational commitment and perception of practice environment, but had negative predictability for intention to leave. The mediating effect of organisational commitment on practice environment and intention to leave was 93·98%, when cultural orientation was not controlled for. It increased slightly to 96·54% when cultural orientation was controlled for. Conclusions: Asian nurses who are more collectivist‐oriented are more willing to accept the goals and values of the organisation, exert effort on behalf of the organisation, are more satisfied with their current practice environment and have less intention to leave their current job. Organisational commitment is a key predictor of Asian nurses’ intention to leave. Relevance to clinical practice: Hospital administrators can use cultural orientation as a strategy to promote organisational commitment amongst Asian nurses, thereby reducing the rate of turnover.

Both European American and Asian participants performed a flanker task while primed with a face (vs control) image. The relative increase of the error-related negativity (ERN) in the face (vs control) priming condition became more pronounced as a function of interdependent (vs independent) self-construal. Relative to European Americans, Asians were more interdependent and, as predicted, they showed a reliably stronger ERN in the face (vs control) priming condition. Our findings suggest that the ERN can serve as a robust empirical marker of self-threat that is closely modulated by socio-cultural variables.

A total of 634 high school students (M = 15.97 years; 95 and 154 first- and second-generation Chinese American respectively, and 385 European Americans) completed measures of parental warmth, parent–adolescent open communication, qin, and psychological adjustment. The U.S.-born Chinese American adolescents' ideals exceeded perceptions of parents' warmth and open communication to a greater degree than it did for European American adolescents (ps < 0.05). Such discrepancies in parental warmth were related to greater internalizing symptoms for second-generation Chinese American youth than for their European American peers. In addition, for second-generation Chinese, their perceptions of qin, particularly parents' devotion and sacrifice, had stronger moderating effects, diminishing the associations between generational cultural gaps and youth's behavioral problems compared with those of European American and first-generation Chinese youth. Parental thoughtfulness also played a similar beneficial role, but did so for all youth.

Although Asian and Caucasian teenagers showed similarities on many value priorities, Asian participants' autonomy expectations were delayed compared to those of their Caucasian counterparts. Mother-teenager autonomy expectations were correlated in Asian but not in Caucasian families. Unlike Asian mothers, Caucasian mothers endorsing high value priority for Openness to Change supported earlier autonomy expectations for their teenagers. Parental expectations unpackaged the effect of culture on teenagers' autonomy expectations.

Informant reports suggest that Panjabi crossing was common, though assessments varied according to its contexts of occurrence. Analysis of spontaneous speech indicated 2 major contexts: (1) agonistic interactions in which Panjabi played an auxiliary role in familiar playground practices, primarily among males (n = 40) and (2) bhangra, in which predominantly White females (n = 6) looked toward a nascent youth culture with Panjabi at its core. Despite major differences, bilingual sponsors and nonconversational structures were crucial in both settings. Multiracial Panjabi was very much a language of local association and seemed more likely to be linked to the development of pluralist, antiracist understandings.

The CERIS-A measures seven ethnic-racial identity attitudes—assimilation, miseducation, self-hatred, anti-dominant, ethnocentricity, multiculturalist inclusive, and ethnic-racial salience. Participants consisted of 803 adults aged 18 to 76, including African Americans (19.3%), Asian Americans (17.6%), European Americans (37.0%), and Latino/as (17.8%). Analyses indicated that CERIS-A scores were reliable, and configural, metric, and scalar invariance were supported for the seven factors across gender; however, Miseducation, Ethnic-Racial Salience, and Ethnocentricity scores achieved only metric invariance across ethnic-racial groups. Self-Hatred, Ethnic-Racial Salience, Anti-Dominant, and Ethnocentricity scores were significantly and meaningfully related to race-based rejection sensitivity scores, providing evidence of convergent validity. We concluded that the CERIS-A is a potentially useful instrument for examining ethnic-racial identity attitudes across multiple racial/ethnic subgroups in the United States.

This occurrence created a unique opportunity to explore how 2 cohorts of students (before and after incident) respond to campus culture and climate indicators. General linear models (GLM) were utilized to take into account changes in overall perceptions of campus culture and climate among multiple racial groups. Specific attention was given to comparing students from the targeted group (Asian students) and nontargeted groups pre- and post-incident to gauge the direct and indirect effects on the broader campus community. Statistically significant differences in reports of negative cross-racial interactions and conversations across differences suggest unfavorable secondary effects of racially biased incidents on Black students’ perceptions of climate. Results also revealed that indicators of campus culture appeared to be less affected by a single incident, whereas climate indicators were more malleable. Results highlight implications for institutional responses and future research to support targeted and nontargeted students of racially biased incidents.

Despite the explosive growth of research on culture and psychology over the last decade of the 20th century and its importance in Asian social psychology, the ontological and epistemological tension between psychology as a science and psychology as a cultural/historical discipline introduced in the writings of the thinkers of the Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment still lingers on in the contemporary discourse of psychology. Clifford Geertz once ominously suggested that cultural psychology may have chewed more than it can. In the present paper, the interpretive turn in social science as exemplified by writings of Charles Taylor and Paul Ricoeur is reviewed and how it may impinge on the practice of Asian social psychology as an empirical science in methodological, epistemological, and ontological respects is discussed. It is argued here that the current practice of Asian social psychology is largely, though not entirely, free of the challenges mounted by these theorists, and that Asian social psychology has an advantage of not being encumbered by this traditional tension due to a monist ontology that is prevalent in Asia.

Our analysis examined racial/ethnic differences in patient satisfaction among patients in multiple combinations of doctor-patient race/ethnicity pairs. Additionally, we outline the determinants of doctor-patient race concordance. The analysis used the 1994 Commonwealth Fund Minority Health Survey to construct a series of multivariate models. We found that for respondents in each race/ethnic group, patients who had a choice in the selection of their physician were more likely to be race concordant. Whites were more likely to be race concordant with their physician compared to African American, Hispanic, and Asian American respondents. Among each race/ethnic group, respondents who were race concordant reported greater satisfaction with their physician compared with respondents who were not race concordant. These findings suggest support for the continuation of efforts to increase the number of minority physicians, while placing greater emphasis on improving the ability of physicians to interact with patients who are not of their own race.

Study 1 tested college students and found, as predicted, that among Euro-Americans a positive effect of perceived emotional support on subjective well-being (positive affect) was weak and, moreover, it disappeared entirely once self-esteem was statistically controlled. In contrast, among Asians in Asia (Japanese and Filipinos) perceived emotional support positively predicted subjective well-being even after self-esteem was controlled. Study 2 extended Study 1 by testing both Japanese and American adults in midlife with respect to multiple indicators of well-being and physical health.

Teacher communication style (TCS) was analyzed from both the students' and teachers' perspectives, and related to students' cultural background and class composition. Four hypotheses were tested: Latino and Asian students will perceive greater teacher dominance than Anglo students; The longer a non-native English-speaking student has lived in the US, the more similar will be his/her perceptions of TCS to those of students born in the US; The greater the number of different cultures and percentage of students from non-US cultures in class, the greater will be the class's perception of teacher dominance; Teachers' perceptions of their own communication styles will be closer to US students' perceptions than to those of Latino and Asian students. Hypothesis 3 was confirmed, Hypotheses 1 and 4 were partially confirmed, and Hypothesis 2 was not confirmed. Interview questions were keyed to the 8 behavior types of the QTI, and appear in the appendix to this paper.

Using a 2-wave sample of Chinese American (n = 237; average age at W1 = 14.65, SD = .68) and Korean American (n = 262; average age at W1 = 14.72, SD = .69) adolescents, this study examined a culturally relevant conditional mechanism through which language brokering may contribute to lower levels of internalizing/externalizing problems. Results suggested that language brokering for the mother was associated with perceived maternal sacrifice, which was in turn associated with respect for the mother, which was eventually associated with lower levels of externalizing problems (but not internalizing problems) in the adolescents. Moreover, the indirect effect was conditional on the level of mother–child open communication. With a lower level of open communication, the indirect effect of language brokering on externalizing problems became stronger. Results indicate that interventions designed to reduce Asian American adolescent language brokers’ externalizing problems may be effective if they target adolescents’ perceptions of parental sacrifice and respect for parents, especially for those adolescents experiencing a low level of parent–child open communication. At the same time, increasing open communication within the family may also ultimately reduce adolescent externalizing problems.

A total of 18 Indochinese participants (organized into three focus groups) and 21 Latino respondents (comprising three focus groups) participated in the study. In addition, one Indochinese and one Latino 'verification' group (consisting of some of the original focus group members) were formed to determine the degree to which the identified interpretive frames made sense as a robust explanation of conflict negotiation from the cultural perspectives of the respondents themselves. Results from the study reveal both a rich set of 'emic' or culture specific frames of conflict negotiation within each of the cultural groups as well as useful 'etic' or culture general interpretive frames for comparing Indochinese and Latino conflict negotiation strategies with law enforcement.

Though partners are similar in age, the victims of such violence are invariably women. Youths' experiences cannot be adequately explained with reference to individual deviance or traditional cultural norms of ethnic groups. These youth are placed between mainstream and ethnic gender regimes and their experience of domestic violence depends on how these regimes work in relation to each other. Thus, their liminal social structural position emerges as a significant factor in their experiences of violence.

However, patterns in relationships between Filial Piety, Socioemotional Development and Authoritative parenting differed across Chinese and Indian mothers. Positive associations were found among these three variables for Indian mothers, reflecting Hindu beliefs about young children and childhood. Among Chinese mothers, on the other hand, Filial Piety was negatively related with Socioemotional Development and the use of Authoritative practices. Our results suggest that Chinese mothers believe that the use of authoritative practices, which encourage Socioemotional development in children, will inhibit achievement of filial behavior and academic achievement.

As predicted, the study found that Asian Americans reported higher scores on depression, loss of face, and intergenerational family conflict than European Americans. Loss of face explained more variance in depression among Asian Americans than European Americans. However, intergenerational family conflict explained equal levels of variance in depression for both groups. A structural equation model revealed that the relationship between race/ethnicity and depression was fully mediated by loss of face and intergenerational family conflict. In conclusion, using the disentangling approach, differences in depression scores between Asian-American and European-American college students can be explained by differences in culturally relevant constructs, such as loss of face and intergenerational family conflict.

A two-site comparative study was used to enable an understanding of how social and economic contexts shape cultural constructions of intimate relationships and sexuality. Focusing on attitudes to ‘love at first sight’, this paper shows that, for Indian participants, love based on physical attraction denotes a lesser kind of love. A relationship based on ‘physical love’ is not expected to last, since it has been formed without regard to family and status concerns. Even couples who meet outside of the arranged marriage system demonstrate the quality of their love by not having sex with one another before marriage. In the UK, however, participants view love as properly spontaneous. Love at first sight is considered desirable and demonstrates how the relationship must be based on love only, without any concern for (for example) material gain. This spontaneous love entails both physical attraction and emotional connection–an early transition to sex, usually before marriage, was seen as both desirable and inevitable.

Explicating the cultural principles at work in East Asian familial norms, the interplay between demands for preserving the 'face' of the family, and the stigmatization of mental health complicate acculturation by imposing restrictions on social behaviors conducive to networking. The institution of family, which operates as a coping resource through social support, also intriguingly acts as the locus of these Confucianist principles and norms, becoming a site where mastery is challenged by notions of maturity that mandate emotional suppression. Depression, social anxiety, and externalizing problems arise in the absence or failure of these coping resources, which percolate into issues of abuse. Implicated is the need for health care reform to encourage treatment among East Asian immigrants by navigating unhealthy behaviors and familial expectations anchored in culture. To this end, this review articulates a more efficient, adaptive, complex system (global patterns) through self-organization inspired by complexity theory and achieved by introducing reflexivity in health education (local interactions).

The results were presented in this paper at the spring meeting of the Transcultural Psychiatry Society, March 1983. West Indian Ss were more commonly admitted to the high security unit, but the rate did not reach statistical significance when compared to the English Ss. Aggression was associated with transfer in all ethnic groups. British Ss labeled uncooperative were most often on open wards, while West Indians and Africans labeled uncooperative were transferred to the high security unit at a significantly higher rate. It is suggested that the staff transferred aggressive Ss regardless of background, but uncooperative Black Ss were transferred at an excessive rate. It is further suggested that these staff actions need to be reviewed.

Indeed, managers around the world are struggling to redefine their roles and responsibilities against a backdrop of the classic ten roles of managers espoused by Mintzberg in the 1970s, which were based on research in the US context. Yet these traditional roles are still widely taught in universities and training programs, and particularly all over Asia with the spread of Western business education literature. The relevance of the Mintzberg formulation in the Asian context was the aim of this four country study. The study reports the importance and degree of use of the ten Mintzberg managerial roles in the contemporary Asian context. The findings suggest although the roles overlap considerably, they are acted out in a very different manner. Implications for the findings in an international market arena are discussed.

Particularly noteworthy is that as many as 45 % of adult rural Hui females are not literate. Possible reasons for the shorter educations of Hui in many segments of the population are numerous. We show that the incentive to invest in length of schooling is smaller among Hui than Han as the association between education and income is weaker. We also report that Hui parents spend fewer resources on education than Han parents and that fewer years of schooling for Hui in the first generation helps to explain why Hui persons in the second generation have shorter educations.

Korean American families live in two cultures and the issue of acculturation challenges their parenting, which is a critical factor for young adolescents' psychological adjustment. Methods: Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to analyze 106 family data (young adolescents, mothers, and fathers) on parenting (acceptance- rejection and behavioral control), acculturation (integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization), and young adolescents' psychological adjustment. Findings: Only young adolescents' reports of maternal and paternal acceptance-rejection were related to their report of psychological adjustment. However, maternal acculturation moderated the relation between mothers' reports of maternal acceptance-rejection and behavioral control and young adolescents' report of their psychological adjustment. Conclusions: Parental acceptance-rejection is related to young adolescents' psychological adjustment when adolescents perceive themselves as accepted or rejected by parents. The relation between mothers' report of maternal acceptance-rejection and behavioral control and adolescents' psychological adjustment needs to be considered within the context of maternal acculturation.

The author comments that while race is not a substitute for carefully assessed social and cultural characteristics, race can be an important indicator of health care disparities and health care delivery. In the study by Bradley et al, the data suggest that rather than focusing on the possibility that some individuals receive worse treatment within a given hospital due to overt or subconscious racial bias, misperception, or patient choice, the problem may lie with the hospitals to which the patients are admitted. The author concludes that determining race can be an important initial step in assessing quality of care delivery and outcomes, as the study by Bradley et al illustrates. However, it is just a first step. By reporting race and ethnicity transparently and beginning to explore other important and related characteristics, biomedical research can move beyond race as a social construct in itself and explore other tangible components that can be affected to improve the public's health.

These families were randomized into an intervention arm or a nonintervention control arm. Using path models, we assessed the effect of the intervention on adolescent girls’ substance use outcomes at 2-year follow-up through family relationships and adolescent self-efficacy pathways. Bias-corrected bootstrapping strategy was employed to assess the significance of the mediation effect by evaluating the 95% confidence interval of the standardized coefficient. The results showed that receiving the intervention exerted a positive effect on girls’ family relationships at 1-year follow-up. Such an improvement was associated with girls’ increased self-efficacy, which in turn led to girls’ decreased alcohol use, marijuana use, and future intention to use substances at 2-year follow-up. Considering the diverse cultural backgrounds, as well as languages, nationalities, and acculturation levels under the umbrella term Asian Americans, we demonstrate that a universal Web-based intervention that tackles the theoretical- and empirical-based risk and protective factors can be effective for Asian Americans. Despite its generic nature, our program may provide relevant tools for Asian American parents in assisting their adolescent children to navigate through the developmental stage and, ultimately, resist substance use.

Fifty-three Chinese psychiatric patients were recruited consecutively from 2 Chinese bilingual psychiatric inpatient units from 2006 to 2010. Two bilingual psychologists interviewed each participant once in a semistructured interview, including 6 questions on mental illness disclosure. Conventional content analysis was applied to conceptualize the phenomenon. Results showed that participants voluntarily disclosed to a circle of people composed primarily of family and relatives. The decisions and strategies to disclose depended on participants’ consideration of 3 critical elements of social relationships. Ganqing, affection associated with relationship building, ultimately determined who had the privilege to know. Renqing, the moral code of reciprocal kindness, further influenced disclosure decisions and what participants anticipated as responses to disclosure. Lastly, concerns over preserving face (lian), a construct representing personal and familial dignity, oftentimes prohibited disclosure. Additionally, in this tight-knit network, involuntary disclosure could happen without participants’ permission or knowledge. Participants commonly suffered from stigma after disclosure. However, half of our participants reported situations in which they experienced little discriminatory treatment, and some experienced support and care as a result of cultural dynamics. Recommendations for culturally sensitive practice to facilitate mental illness disclosure among Chinese immigrants were discussed.

Patients’ perceived barriers to managing cancer pain may be influenced by culture. This meta-analysis compared differences in Western and Asian patient-perceived barriers to managing cancer pain. Methods: the literature was systematically reviewed to compare pain barriers in Western and Asian cancer patients in 22 studies that used Ward’s Barrier Questionnaire. Differences in weighted barrier scores were compared by meta-regression analysis. Results: Asian cancer patients had higher barrier scores than Western patients, except for barriers of ‘good patient’, ‘side effects’, ‘distract physician’, ‘fear of injections’, and ‘addiction’. Meta-regression analysis indicated that Asian patients’ perceived pain barriers differed significantly from those of Western patients for disease progression (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80, 1.84, p < 0.0001), tolerance (WMD = 1.63; 95% CI 0.91, 2.36, p < 0.0001), fatalism (WMD = 0.89; 95% CI 0.28, 1.52, p = 0.004), and total score (WMD = 0.82; 95% CI 0.36, 1.28, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Asian patients’ perceived barriers to managing cancer pain were significantly higher than those for Western patients (especially for concerns about disease progression, tolerance, and fatalism).

This group spurred the interest of researchers because of their new immigrant status and their demographic and sociocultural background that places them at a significant disadvantage compared with the majority of already established Chinese immigrants. This paper synthesizes existing research on the Fuzhounese’s historical/cultural and migration experiences and examines ways in which sociocultural forces interact with postmigration stressors to impact the onset, manifestation, diagnosis, and treatment of symptoms in this group. From prior ethnographic work, we suggest that the pursuit of four core social goals plays a key role in interfering with psychiatric treatment adherence: (1) To payoff their smuggling debt (often > $80,000); (2) To send money to their natal families to improve social standing; (3) To save money for a dowry to perpetuate the familial lineage by marrying and producing offspring; and (4) To attain legal status. To offer more insight on how these core social motivations impact psychiatric disability, we present a case vignette of a Fuzhounese man diagnosed with schizophrenia.

In Fiji, these conflicting perspectives are revealed in discursive blind spots that were most pronounced after the two 1987 coups, in which the Fijian military ousted an Indian-dominated, democratically-elected government, and then executed a second coup 4 months later, resulting in a coalition government with ousted government members. Both the 'backward' group and the 'advanced' group perceive deprivation relative to the other group. This begins as each group makes the elites of the other group the basis for comparison with their own ethnic group. Both groups, then, seek entitlements that redress this sense of subordination and disenfranchisement. However, each group defines entitlements in ways that cancel out the claims of the other, since these entitlements are mutually exclusive. Both groups articulate distinct sources of legitimacy: the 'advanced' group defines its legitimacy to stake claims to entitlements, while the 'backward' group evokeds notions of legitimacy to defend its entitlements.

Some attitudinal research has shown that Asian American college males tend to hold more rape-supportive beliefs than their White counterparts. Generally, this research treats ethnicity as a proxy for culture rather than examining specific facets of culture per se. The current study incorporated measures of misogynistic beliefs, acculturation, and ethnic identity to investigate these ethnic differences in rape-supportive attitudes. White (n = 222) and Asian American (n = 155) college men read an acquaintance rape vignette and evaluated it on four judgments: how much they blamed the perpetrator and the victim, how credible they viewed the victim’s refusal, and to what degree they defined the event as rape. Consistent with previous research, Asian American men made more rape-supportive judgments than Whites. This relationship was partially mediated by misogynistic beliefs for all judgments except the extent to which they defined the vignette as rape. Among Asian Americans, acculturation was negatively associated with all four rape vignette judgments above and beyond generational status, and ethnic identity was positively associated with two of the four judgments above and beyond acculturation and generational status. These findings suggest that cultural constructs are relevant to understanding rape-supportive attitudes among Asian American men, and may be useful for promoting culturally enhanced theoretical models of rape and sexual assault prevention efforts, as well as a deeper understanding of cultural influences on sexuality.

Using a combination of ethnographic data from his own fieldwork in Japan and ethnographic literature focused on other cultures, the author argues that as an analytic category 'religion' is problematic because basic elements of that category, such as faith or the notion of the transcendent, have been developed in terms of a predominately Christian or Western theological framework that is not necessarily appropriate for research in non-Western cultural contexts.

The r/K theory of criminal and antisocial behavior (L. Ellis and A. Walsh (1997)) asserts that criminals and psychopaths are at one end of an evolutionary continuum in terms of how they approach reproduction. At the K-end are persons who proliferate their genes by investing inordinate time and energy in caring for a small number of offspring, and at the r-end are persons who reproduce prolifically and provide minimal care for offspring. Results are consistent with the hypothesis, showing that in 1988 and 1994, Blacks do have significantly higher multiple birth and arrest rates than Whites, and Whites have significantly higher rates than Asian-Americans.

Findings show that across all three distress indicators, East Asian Americans were more benefited when they construed support as mutual versus non-mutual, whereas European Americans’ response did not differ by support condition. Furthermore, the data support previous research showing that Asian Americans are more likely to seek support from discretionary (i.e., peers) than obligatory ties (i.e., parents).

It is argued that Ms. A. may be struggling to negotiate Asian and American cultural identities, as well as to resolve the conflict she experiences between traditionally masculine and feminine identities. This combination of conflicts, especially in the setting of a fragmented and fragile sense of inner identity, most likely led her to come dependent upon external sources of validation. These conflicts also led her to persistent attempts to mask her inner turmoil through changes in her outer appearance. This case provides an illustration of psychopathology deeply embedded in its cultural context. The case serves as a general reminder that treatment that is culturally decontextualized is, at best, insensitive and, at worst, ineffective or harmful. Her treatment must be informed by a culture-specific understanding of identity, intergenerational conflicts, and social and familial stressors and supports.

This racial grid continues to be a simplification of the actual complexity of lived identities and experiences, particularly for people of mixed descent. In this context, we explore the contemporary meanings and resonances of racial identity and national belonging as negotiated among members of a historic mixed-descent community—the Eurasians – in the context of a nation-state built on an institutionally fixed racial template. As a community, Eurasians are commonly attributed to the presence and mixing of especially Dutch, Portuguese and British—but also other Europeans—with an equally variegated palette of Asian cultures, since the 16th century. Based on 30 biographical interviews with self- identified Eurasians of two generations, this paper examines how individual and collective narratives of ‘old’ hybrid identities are changing in relation to the emergence of potentially new hierarchies of racial belonging with the arrival of new migration and the rise of international marriage in globalizing times. Given the lived reality of an expanding range of ‘race’ identities of different permutations and combinations, the politics of choice is played out between countervailing forces which draw racialized boundaries around the community more tightly on the one hand, and liberalize claims to racial and national belonging on the basis of self-identification on the other.

Conducting neuropsychological evaluations with persons who do not speak the language of the examiner is fraught with problems identified in the literature. First, most tests were designed for and evaluated on Caucasian, English-speaking persons from the US and/or Canada. Second, serious errors in the administration, scoring, and interpretation of neuropsychological tests can occur if interpreters are used to translate the tests during the evaluation. Third, tests that are translated may not be culture fair; scores on these tests may be systematically affected by cultural or language factors. This may place certain ethnic groups at a distinct disadvantage and, in certain circumstances, may be discriminatory. Fourth, using 'improper' norms can lead to biased and inaccurate conclusions.

Among the native born, the color line for earnings cuts mainly across white and nonwhite when field of study and Carnegie classification are controlled for in addition to other covariates. On the other hand, among members of the 1.5 generation, who obtained both their high school and highest degrees in the United States, the lines are most salient between black and nonblack. Among first‐generation immigrants, who completed all their education in a foreign country, and 1.25‐generation immigrants, who obtained their high school diploma in a foreign country but earned their highest degree in the United States, there is a gradation of the color line with whites at the top and blacks at the bottom.

A strong CRR effect was observed between Black and White Ss, such that Ss from either racial group were more likely to recognize faces of their own race and more likely to have a false alarm to faces of the other race. Latinos and Asians also were less accurate in their recognition of Black faces than Black Ss, but they were no less accurate in their recognition of White faces than White Ss. Face recognition was more accurate when Ss from any of the racial groups were induced to be in unpleasant moods vs pleasant moods. However, mood did not interact with the CRR effect, and thus mood is unlikely to be a mediating variable for the effect.

It is a serious global health problem and more commonly seen in women. A 2007 technical report on osteoporosis from the World Health Organization estimates that osteoporosis affects more than 200 million women worldwide. Although calcium is not the only determinant of bone mineral density, optimal levels of calcium are essential for building and maintaining strong bones. Milk and other dairy products are among the major sources of calcium in the United States. Recommendations for calcium for women up to age 50 are 1,000 mg/day, and the recommendation increases to 1,200 mg/day for women after age 50. Vitamin D is required for proper absorption of calcium and bone health. Synthesis of vitamin D is made in the skin after exposure to sunlight. The recommended daily intake of vitamin D is 600 units for children and adults up to age 70, and 800 units for people above 70. The low vitamin D status may indicate that Asian American females spent less time outdoors. In most Asian cultures, people believe that women with whiter or lighter skin are more attractive and beautiful. Asian women may be willing to do anything to make their skin whiter. Consequently, Asian women may stay out of the sunlight and cover the skin with clothes to stay white. Knowledge about osteoporosis among Asian American women was inadequate. Osteoporosis and its related fractures impose a considerable economic burden on the US health care system. Asian American women appear to be a high risk group for developing osteoporosis. While this population lives longer on average than any other US ethnic populations, the aging of Asian American women is expected to increase the prevalence of osteoporosis and fracture risk. It is important that osteoporosis prevention strategies start in the teenage years to promote a bone healthy lifestyle among Asian American women.

Artifactual differences between cultures were also tested in terms of explaining the differences with concomitant variability. Couples with children ranging in age from 1 to 10 yrs were drawn from 4 subcultures (22 Mexican American, 20 Black American, 27 White American, and 18 Japanese American). The most salient and consistent finding was the pronounced significance of the covariate controls (especially father's education and mother's religiosity): Although a few cross-cultural effects remained significant despite the influence of a covariate, most of the findings were biased by a concomitant (i.e., demographic) variable.

We studied the joint influences of parents and television on children’s expression of four basic emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, and fear) using self-report survey data from 3570 six- to 15-year-olds from 13 Asian, European, Middle Eastern, and South American countries. Perceived parental approval positively predicted self-reported expression of all four emotions. In addition, children’s approval of TV characters’ expression of happiness and anger (but not sadness and fear) positively predicted self-reported expressions of these emotions. A multilevel model combining cultural indicators (individualism, indulgence, assertiveness, humane orientation) and sociopolitical variables (Human Development Index, Gender Inequality Index, Grade Point Average) at the country level with individual-level variables (age, gender, media use) suggested that parental socialization of sadness, and media socialization of anger, varied as a function of some cultural indicators (assertiveness and humane orientation). Overall, though, despite theorizing about cultural differences, parental approval and (to a lesser extent) children’s approval of media models tended to predict children’s emotion displays rather consistently across a wide array of countries.

Talking about past troubles occurred while the nonnative speakers were interviewing Australian native speakers who in relating their life story happened to reveal some past afflictions. These interviews were part of an assignment for an English as a second language class. The talk about troublesome past events may develop into past troubles-talk or may be conducted as story-telling depending on the participants' orientation to the activity. In effect, past-troubles talk is a collaborative accomplishment and participants may shift their orientation during the talk. Talk about past troubles may involve talking about delicate matters, which may pose further interactional difficulties when the recipient is a learner of English, which is the case in this study.

With 4-year panel data from young adolescents (N = 968, 50.7% girls; Mage = 13.3 years) in South Korea, this study examined the effects of cultural environmental factors (parents’ excessive interference, communication with parents, and friends’ and teachers’ support) on pathological gaming through academic stress and self-control. The results showed the critical role of academic stress and self-control in the effects of environmental factors on pathological gaming. Parents’ excessive interference increased the degree to which youth experienced academic stress while the degree of communication with parents decreased this stress. Increased academic stress damaged self-control, which finally increased the degree of pathological gaming. Self-control affected the degree of pathological gaming stronger than gaming time did. The theoretical and practical implications from the study findings are discussed.

A survey of 445 randomly sampled women, aged 20-40 in Hanoi, Vietnam, revealed that pre-consultation attitudes were most positive toward a 'shared' decision-making approach with the physician for contraceptive method choice. However, following random assignment to one of three vignettes (passive, shared or autonomous) featuring a young Vietnamese woman reaching a contraceptive method decision with her physician, preference was highest for the 'autonomous' approach. Furthermore, discordance between pre-consultation preference for decision-making style and the physician's decision-making style negatively impacted evaluations under some but not all circumstances. This study demonstrates that, despite living in a hierarchic Asian culture, active participation in contraceptive method choice is desired by many urban Vietnamese women. However, there is variation on this dimension and adjusting the physician's style to be concordant with patient preference appears important to maximizing patient satisfaction.

Interviews were conducted with Nepalese participants with type 2 diabetes in Sydney and Kathmandu; and data was thematically analysed. Diet was recognized as a cause of, and a key treatment modality, in diabetes. Besides doctors, participants in Nepal received a large amount of dietary information from the community. Dietary changes formed a major component of lifestyle modifications adopted after diagnosis, and mostly consisted of removal of foods with added sugar and foods with high total sugar content from the diet, and a reduction in overall quantity of foods consumed. Perceived dietary restriction requirements created social and emotional discomfort to patients. Most participants perceived the Nepalese food culture as a barrier to effective diet management. Meals high in carbohydrates, limited food choices, and food preparation methods were identified as barriers, particularly in Nepal. In Australia, participants reported greater availability and easier access to appropriate food, and healthier cooking options. The socio-cultural aspects of food behaviour, mainly, food practices during social events were identified as significant barriers. Although diet was acknowledged as an important component of diabetes care, and most adopted changes in their diet post-diagnosis, effective and sustained changes were difficult to achieve. Future public health campaigns and education strategies should focus on improving diet knowledge, awareness of food options for diabetes, and effective dietary management.

Blumer (1958) and whether such perceptions spring from simple self-interest, orthodox prejudice, or broad beliefs about social stratification and inequality. 1,869 adults were interviewed (Whites, Blacks, Latinos, and Asians) to analyze the distribution and social and psychological underpinnings of perceived group competition. Results support the racial alienation hypothesis and the hypotheses positing effects for self-interest, prejudice, and stratification beliefs. Blumer's framework offers the most parsimonious integration and interpretation of the social psychological processes involved in the formation of perceptions of group threat and competition.

A social identity analysis of intergroup prejudice was adopted, such that perceptions of the intergroup structure (instability, permeability, legitimacy and higher ingroup status) were proposed as predictors of higher prejudice (blatant and covert) and less favorable stereotyping. Consistent with the social identity approach, both independent and interacting roles for sociostructural predictors of Anti-Asian bias were observed, even after demographic and personality variables were controlled. For example, perceived legitimacy was associated with higher prejudice when White Australians' status position relative to Asian Australians was valued. Moreover, when participants evaluated Whites' position as unstable and high status or legitimate, perceptions of permeable intergroup boundaries were associated with anti-Asian bias. The present findings demonstrate status protection responses in advantaged group members in a field setting, lending weight to the contention that perceptions of sociostructural threat interact to predict outgroup derogation.

This other-race effect has been argued to be the result of perceptual expertise, whereby face-specific perceptual mechanisms are tuned through experience. We designed new tasks to determine whether other-race effects extend to categorizing faces by national origin. We began by selecting sets of face stimuli for these tasks that are typical in appearance for each of six nations (three Caucasian, three Asian) according to people from those nations (Study 1). Caucasian and Asian participants then categorized these faces by national origin (Study 2). Own-race faces were categorized more accurately than other-race faces. In contrast, Asian American participants, with more extensive other-race experience than the first Asian group, categorized other-race faces better than own-race faces, demonstrating a reversal of the other-race effect. Therefore, other-race effects extend to the ability to categorize faces by national origin, but only if participants have greater perceptual experience with own-race, than other-race faces. Study 3 ruled out non-perceptual accounts by showing that Caucasian and Asian faces were sorted more accurately by own-race than other-race participants, even in a sorting task without any explicit labelling required. Together, our results demonstrate a new other-race effect in sensitivity to national origin of faces that is linked to perceptual expertise.

Multiple regression analyses showed that each of the three sets of predictors (achievement goals, sense of self, facilitating conditions) explained a significant amount of the variance in almost all of the outcome measures.

Most respondents narrated their sense of indebtedness to parents, verbally acknowledging appreciation for parents’ hardship and sacrifice; however, they differed in how much they internalized indebtedness, varying in level of personalization and perception of salience of indebtedness. Similarly, youth did not differ in how they described the role of their felt indebtedness in shaping their behavior toward parents (including filial responsibility, desire for success, and promoting positive interactions) but their motivations and interpretations of these behaviors differed depending on the degree of internalization of sense of indebtedness.

We find that context affects the reporting of children's racial identity. We examine these effects with models that incorporate three spatial scales: households, neighborhoods and metropolitan areas. Model estimates reveal that racial claims made by parents of Latino- and Asian-white (but not black-white) children varied significantly across metropolitan area. A neighborhood's proportion white increased the probability that parents reported their children as white, while a neighborhood's racial diversity increased the probability that black-white parents claimed a non-white race (black or 'other') for their children.

Providers and staff at 39 telemedicine sites rated patients’ access to mental health care, need for culturally competent telepsychiatric consultation, and need for language interpreters. Compared to sites that did not respond, responder sites had greater telemedicine experience (e.g., obtained more telepsychiatric and telemedicine consultations).

Both access to and quality of telepsychiatric services with attention to cultural issues and language interpreting is very much needed, particularly for the large number of Hispanic and Vietnamese patients. Because untrained staff and family members are commonly used in clinical situations with limited English proficiency patients, solutions for managing language differences are also needed. More structured, qualitative and quantitative in-depth research is required to ascertain to what extent providers and staff are aware of these patients’ needs, how cultural and language barriers can be reduced, and the pros and cons of different types of interpreters.

The results show support for our argument that place plays a central role in Pacific identity processes, illustrated in this case among Hawaiians. We find that strong ties to Hawaii - the spiritual and geographic home of the Hawaiian population - are vital to the intergenerational transmission of Hawaiian identification in both continental and island multiracial families. We compare our results for multiracial Native Hawaiians to prior studies of American Indians and Asian Americans to identify any general patterns in correlates of racial identification choices.

However, whether abused women from non-Western cultures experience similar post-traumatic responses to intimate partner violence is less documented. Objectives: The objectives of this paper were (1) to review the literature for information about post-traumatic stress disorder among Chinese women survivors of intimate partner violence; (2) to provide a synthesis of the literature on post-traumatic stress disorder among abused Chinese women; and (3) to identify implications for practice and to suggest directions for research relating to post-traumatic stress disorder among abused Chinese women. Design: A systematic review of the literature. Data Sources: Following a systematic search for relevant literature in computerized databases and manual searches of English and Chinese language publications, five papers reporting on four studies conducted in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and the United States were included in the review. Review Methods: Abstracts meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed independently by two of the authors and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Full papers for selected abstracts were then retrieved and assessed independently by the same reviewers. Results: The present literature review revealed a paucity of information relating to posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms or diagnoses in abused Chinese women. Nevertheless, a link between post-traumatic stress disorder and intimate partner violence was demonstrated by the reviewed papers. Conclusions: Caution should be exercised when making comparison of the findings across the four studies because of the inherent methodological differences. Also, as the assessment tools have not been validated for culture-bound interpretation of trauma and symptom manifestation, comparisons of findings for Chinese women to women in Western literature should be undertaken with due consideration. Implications for practice and recommendations for future research are discussed.

Univariate analyses resulted in Asian males reporting significantly higher BD than Caucasian males. Bivariate correlations indicated that BD was significantly and positively correlated with internalization and ABRS in Asian and Caucasian males. Masculinity was negatively correlated with BD in Caucasian males only. Multiple regressions indicated that the only independent predictors of BD were internalization and ABRS. This study suggests that male Asian university students in Australia are at particular risk of developing body image disturbances, irrespective of their level of acculturation. Further studies replicating the influence of ABRS on a broader range of cultures and genders may help to investigate the generalizability of these findings.

International students who perceived their cultural group to be relatively low in status experienced lower levels of psychological adjustment. Also, as expected, the effects of status were moderated by perceptions of both the permeability of intergroup boundaries and the legitimacy of the status differential. At high levels of legitimacy, perceptions of permeable group boundaries were associated with better psychological, sociocultural, and academic adjustment among international students perceiving their group to be low in status, but lower levels of adjustment among students who perceived their group to be high in status. At low levels of legitimacy, irrespective of group status position, perceived permeability was not related to adjustment.

To explore the determinants of use of traditional healers, the authors studied demographics, health status, and social support networks of 223 elderly Koreans (aged 65+ yrs) in Los Angeles County, California. The results revealed that chronic conditions such as arthritis, lung disease, and stomach pain; fewer depressive symptoms; availability of health insurance; and stronger social networks were significant predictors of use of traditional healers.

Participants included 139 Anglo-Saxon volunteer university students (60 male, 79 female, ages 18–29 yrs). The findings highlight the fact that attitudes were significantly positive towards Aboriginals compared with attitudes towards Asians and Arabs. However, Asian stereotypes were distinctively positive compared to the 2 other target groups. Multiple regression analyses indicate that affective measures were often better predictors of attitudes towards minority groups. Overall, the results indicate the importance of emotional stakes as crucial components of racial attitudes in Australia. The implications of these findings suggest that attitude change programs, which have traditionally been based on simply changing cognitive aspects of attitudes (e.g., knowledge structures, facts about racial groups) should also take into consideration the roles of affective features of attitudes (e.g., anxiety, distrust, frustration evoked by racial groups).

Per betrayal trauma theory, high betrayal trauma is abuse perpetrated by someone close to the victim, medium betrayal trauma is abuse perpetrated by someone not close, low betrayal trauma involves no identifiable perpetrator, and as level of betrayal increases so does posttraumatic distress and trauma-related memory disruption. Seventy-nine Japanese university students completed an anonymous online survey of trauma experiences, psychological health and cultural values. It was hypothesized that high betrayal childhood abuse (physical, sexual, and emotional maltreatment and/or neglect) would predict greater psychological distress and trauma-related memory disruption than would medium betrayal trauma and these hypotheses were partially supported. Endorsement of traditional Asian cultural values (e.g., interpersonal harmony) was not a significant moderator on the betrayal effects found. The findings partially support predictions of betrayal trauma theory in a non-Western culture and have intervention and prevention implications.

There is substantial evidence that physicians’ attitudes towards and beliefs about chronic low back pain can influence their subsequent management of the condition. Objectives: (1) to evaluate the attitudes and beliefs towards chronic low back pain among primary care physicians in Asia; (2) to study the cultural differences and other factors that are associated with these attitudes and beliefs. Method: A cross sectional online survey was sent to primary care physicians who are members of the Hong Kong College of Family Physician (HKCFP). The Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapist (PABS-PT) was used as the questionnaire to determine the biomedical and biopsychosocial orientation of the participants. Results: The mean Biomedical (BM) score was 34.8+/-6.1; the mean biopsychosocial (BPS) score was 35.6 (+/- 4.8). Both scores were higher than those of European doctors. Family medicine specialists had a lower biomedical score than General practitioners. Physicians working in the public sector tended to have low BM and low BPS scores; whereas physicians working in private practice tended to have high BM and high BPS scores. Conclusion: The lack of concordance in the pain explanatory models used by private and public sector may have a detrimental effect on patients who are under the care of both parties. The uncertain treatment orientation may have a negative influence on patients’ attitudes and beliefs, thus contributing to the tension and, perhaps, even ailing mental state of a person with chronic LBP.

We propose a holistic approach that incorporates perspectives of both Indonesians and their Asian co-workers to elaborate their cross-cultural experiences. Eighty-one in-depth interviews were conducted in Indonesia and China using Indonesian sojourners and locals (N = 47) as well as their Chinese and Singaporean co-workers (N = 34). A grounded theory data analysis was conducted using atlas.ti software. A model of Indonesian intercultural competences in international work groups was developed to depict four core intercultural competences: motivating leadership, personable mediation, climate management and multiculturalism. Three potential synergy and problematic areas are identified: the meaning of work, communication style, and perception of competition versus harmony. Future research directions and practical implications to improve intercultural effectiveness among these three cultures are discussed.

The authors highlight their editorial process and practice in safeguarding research integrity at JCHRM and address related ethical issues on duplicate submissions in relation to their editorial experience. Design/methodology/approach: This article adopts an approach combining literature review and reflexive analysis. Findings: The current academic misconduct and ethical concerns in China are caused by a number of concurrent counterforces: increased attractive opportunities in moonlighting; research mindset rooted in the traditional learning orientation on imitation and contemporary education on rote learning; and heightened publication-based performance requirement enforced by the government and institutions. These counterforces are further complicated by the ongoing socio-cultural context, e.g. the drinking and eating culture. The authors report their editorial steps in safeguarding research integrity and commitment to excellence. In relation to submitting translated published papers to an English journal, they emphasize that originality is the core. They are committed to facilitate the transition of Chinese HRM research community to conform to the international standard. Originality/value: This article links professional ethics, research integrity, and commitment to excellence to developing Chinese scholarly human resources.

The S was put on testosterone supplements and a behavioral program. There was improvement in self care and work performance, but not in lying. Verbal performance discrepancy in IQ suggests a CNS dysfunction. Falsification of family background by the S indicated low self esteem. The created pseudo-reality served more to bolster a public image, than to produce narcissistic gratification. Through lying and creation of a myth of an ideal family, the S avoided contempt from the society, minimized shame, and thus, 'saved face'. The importance of keeping 'face' and maintaining modest behavior in the Chinese culture is central to this psychopathology.

Spirituality is shaped by larger social circumstances and by the beliefs and values present in the wider culture. In Asia, as compared to other regions, people fall back on spiritualism. Mental health professionals, laymen and patients have great interest in spirituality and religious activities but still it is one of the most neglected fields of life. Spirituality and religion often are used interchangeably and it has also been described as an individual search for meaning. In psychiatry, religion and spirituality play a vital role in an individual's personal and social life. They are part of a very powerful medium to help in the healing process. Spiritual people know the meaning and goal of their life, have strong belief and firm faith in God or themselves, they can easily cope with stress and have the ability to adjust in every situation. They have satisfaction and contentment. They are less anxious and depressed and if they feel so, they try to overcome it through religious activities or rituals. Patients who depend heavily on their religious faith are significantly less depressed than those who don't. Spiritual practices foster an awareness that serves to identify and promote values such as creativity, patience, perseverance, honesty, kindness, compassion, wisdom, equanimity, hope and joy, all of which support good healthcare practice. Spirituality and religion form a bridge of contact between human, a composite of body and soul, and the Creator. Realizing this need, mental health professionals working in this field need to understand the spiritual values of patients and incorporate them in assessment and treatment.

Subcultural groupings were differentiated by South Asian origin, English fluency, religion, and gender. Stressful situations assessed were experience of assault, stress/dissatisfaction with work overcrowding, low standard of living, absence of family and absence of confidants. Results showed that the GHQ-12 was less sensitive to certain stressful situations than the other 2 measures. The PSS and/or self-assessed distress were more sensitive to low standard of living, self-rated stress in housework and experience of assault. In conclusion, the greater distress of women, Muslims and limited English speakers is largely explained by the stressful situations they experience.

Following each role play, participants state anger, and resentful and reflective cognitions pertaining to anger were assessed. Participants' videotaped behavioral responses were assessed for problem-solving skills and negative and positive verbal and nonverbal behaviors. Blood pressure and heart rate (HR) responses were recorded throughout the session. Results revealed that Indian participants used more introspective strategies comprising of repression and rational coping self-statements to anger provocation than their White counterparts. White participants experienced significantly higher HR responses and showed more awareness of physiological sensation compared to the Indian participants, but only when asked to exhibit their anger. Indian participants had a faster diastolic blood pressure (DBF) recovery when allowed to engage in anger inhibition (which is a culturally determined mode of functioning) compared to when they had to exhibit anger before inhibiting it. White men showed a heightened cardiac response to anger expression, something not seen among Indian men.

However, concurrent examination of these variables has been rare. The present study assessed parental alcohol use, acculturation and ALDH2 gene status in relation to lifetime, current and heavy episodic drinking among Chinese and Korean American undergraduates. Method: Participants (N = 428, 51% women; 52% Chinese American, age 18-19 years) were first-year college students in a longitudinal study of substance use initiation and progression. Data were collected via structured interview and self-report, and participants provided a blood sample for genotyping at the ALDH2 locus. Results: Gender, parental alcohol use and acculturation significantly predicted drinking behavior. However, none of the hypothesized moderating relationships were significant. In contrast with previous studies, ALDH2 gene status was not associated with alcohol use. Conclusions: Results indicate that although the variables examined influence alcohol use, moderating effects were not observed in the present sample of Asian American college students. Findings further suggest that the established association of ALDH2 status and drinking behavior in Asians may not be evident in late adolescence. It is possible that ALDH2 status is associated with alcohol consumption only following initiation and increased drinking experience.

The higher mortality rates and the shorter life expectancy in Asian men compared with their women counterparts show the disadvantaged status of men’s health. Thus, discussions on men’s health should address their health needs and not be confined to sex-specific male urology and reproductive health. In Asia, assessing men’s health needs is challenging because of the vast differences in the socioeconomic status and the diverse culture among its member countries. Although, the epidemiology of men’s health provides the focus for what to address in improving men’s health, having an optimal strategy requires the understanding of men’s health-seeking behaviors and the social determinants surrounding them.

The analysis, which is based on an interview survey, reveals that there is broad support for local self-governance. Nonetheless, public perceptions of the efficiency and autonomy of local government are largely negative in nature. Popular involvement in local politics and voluntary associations is low, and a sense of citizen empowerment is lacking. Overall, the quality of local government and democratic citizenship in Korea is found to remain far short of democratic ideals. These findings, of the undergrowth of civic culture and social capital, indicate that grassroots democracy in Korea is still at the electoral stage, and not yet fully consolidated.

In this study we analyzed advertisements collected from women's fashion and beauty magazines in Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States to compare the ways in which Western and Asian models were portrayed in print advertisements. We found that although demure dress was used most often for both races, Western models were shown more frequently than Asian models in seductive dress. Western models were also posed more often than Asian models as the Seductive beauty type. Product categories also differed. Asian models were used more frequently in advertisements for hair and skin beauty products, whereas Western models dominated the clothing category. The findings suggest that Western models are used more than Asian models in advertisements which are 'body' oriented, and that Western models are used in advertisements in Asia when the underlying marketing strategy is that 'sex sells.'

Among both Black and Latino Americans, the relationship between religiosity and conservative politics is far weaker than it is among White Americans, and it is sometimes altogether absent. In Study 3, a tradition-focused view of religion was found to more strongly mediate the link between religiosity and political attitudes among Whites than it did among Blacks and Latinos.

However, Blumenthal contends that the authors did not analyze their data according to ethnicity, using fairly traditional groupings (i.e., white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and other) that are conglomerates of diverse ethnicities rather than ethnic groups. While the harassment experienced by some of the Ss was a social rather than a biologic phenomenon, in most cases the harassment was probably based on the individual's physical appearance (i.e., race) rather than her ethnicity.

Methods: We analyze data from a five-year pool of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) collected between 1997 and 2001 (N = 162,032) and employ multivariate regression techniques to explore level of psychological distress of various ethnic groups relative to non-Hispanic whites. Results: Nonwhite populations exhibit variable base-line differences in psychological distress compared to non-Hispanic whites; however, adjusted estimates show that African Americans and Mexicans have lower levels of distress while distress scores for 'other Hispanics,' Asians, and Cubans exhibit statistically similar levels. The highest distress occurs for Puerto Ricans. Interaction models reveal chronic sources of stress (e.g., poverty, chronic illness, nonmarriage) are even more taxing on psychological health of high-risk groups or have weaker relationships to stress for other groups.

We use hierarchical linear models to take into account differences in the availability of teaching hospitals to different groups. These models look within groups of people who live in the same county and ask what demographic factors make an individual within that county more or less likely to use a teaching hospital. Blacks are much more likely than whites to use teaching hospitals. However, Hispanics and Asian-Americans are less likely to use teaching hospitals than are whites whites (Hispanic OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.97; Asian-American odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.97).

This research was conducted with young, single middle- and upper middle-class women between the ages of 17 and 21 years old. The project demonstrates that the practice of reading Western romance fiction is deeply embedded within patriarchal discourses of feminine respectability that exert control over women's sexuality. Young women's fascination for the commodities of Western material culture in imported romance fiction is located in their desire to experience their identities as cosmopolitan, global consumers. In negotiating the boundaries of tradition, Indian women readers construct romance fiction as modern manuals on sexuality that afford them escape from the burdens of preserving the honor of family and community. The contradictory character of women's interpretations of sexuality in Western romance novels highlights the complex dialectic between postcolonial audiences' resistance to and collusion with the hegemony of global culture.

Drawing inspiration from King's vision, across two datasets with White and Asian college students (N = 1,957, N = 1,324), this article finds support for the power of participation in inclusive diversity efforts associated with underrepresented groups (i.e., Latina/o and African Americans) to benefit intergroup attitudes. Specifically, participating in an academic course or activity that involves Latina/o/x or African American culture is related to greater outgroup closeness and more supportive perceptions of policies that address inequality. Perceptions of policies included attitudes toward the merits of affirmative action, use of multicultural (vs. colorblind) approaches to diversity, and endorsement of structural (vs. individual) explanations for inequality. These results held controlling for other types of contact (i.e., outgroup friendships, roommates, interactions), college‐level demographic diversity, and prior intergroup attitudes and diversity exposure. The importance of engagement in inclusive diversity efforts for achieving integration is discussed.

This proposition is investigated in studies of consumer decisions that involve a trade-off between diverging attributes, such as low price and high quality. It was predicted that cultural differences in the tendency to choose compromise options will be greater when the decision task requires that Ss provide reasons. A total of 803 Ss participated in 5 experiments. In Exp 1, a difference between Hong Kong Chinese and US Ss in the tendency to select compromise products emerged only when Ss were asked to explain their decisions, with Hong Kong decision makers more likely to compromise. Exps 2 and 3 replicated the interactive effect of culture and the need to provide reasons in a comparison of US vs Japanese Ss and of European-American and Asian-American Ss, respectively. Exps 4 and 5 found that Hong Kong Chinese Ss, compared with US Ss, evaluated proverbs and the reasons of others more positively when these favored compromise. The value of conceptualizing cultural influences in terms of dynamic strategies rather than as dispositional tendencies is discussed.

In Japan, deinstitutionalization has been delayed, and outreach services were not developed until recently. However, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare announced in its 2004 report Mental Health and Medical Welfare Vision of Reform that the national policy of mental health must shift from hospital-oriented treatments to community-oriented treatments. As a result, many pioneering outreach activities are beginning to appear. In this article, we review outreach services in Japan of assertive community treatment (ACT), psychiatric home-visit nursing (PHVN), and the welfare-based outreach program known as home-visit life skills coaching. To provide outreach services of all types to people with mental illness, the separate roles of ACT, PHVN, and home-visit life skills coaching must be clearly defined. However, few agencies provide outreach services to people with mental illness in the Japanese psychiatric system. Thus, we must promote studies and activities that demonstrate the effectiveness of such services and change the culture of psychiatric services from hospital oriented to community oriented.

A multiprocesses model is tested to examine the mediating roles of ambivalence over emotional expression (AEE), avoidance, intrusive thoughts, and social support in the association between social constraints and depressive symptoms among Chinese American breast cancer survivors. Methods: Ninety-six Chinese American breast cancer survivors were recruited from Chinese community organizations. They were asked to complete a questionnaire package that assessed social constraints, AEE, avoidance, intrusive thoughts, social support, depressive symptoms, and demographic information. Path analysis was conducted to test the hypothesized model. Results: The overall and specific indirect effects of social constraints on depressive symptoms through AEE, avoidance, intrusive thoughts, and social support are significant. When the mediators are controlled for, the direct effect of social constraints on depressive symptoms is no longer significant. Conclusions: A multiprocesses model of social constraints and depressive symptoms is tested in a sample of Chinese American breast cancer survivors. The findings suggest that the existence of multiple pathways through which social constraints may associate with depressive symptoms among Chinese American breast cancer survivors.

Ss also completed the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-II (DSM-II) (Revised) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). With the exception of minor differences, sleep continuity, sleep architecture, and REM sleep patterns were comparable among the 4 groups. African-American Ss showed evidence of more stages 1 and 2 sleep and diminished stage 4 sleep, whereas the Hispanic Ss had higher REM density. These preliminary findings suggest that sleep patterns are remarkably similar across cultures. There are, however, important cross-ethnic differences, specifically in the depth of sleep and in phasic REM measures. None of the sleep measures were influenced by HDRS score. Because sleep disturbances are common symptoms of emotional disorders and since many psychoactive agents affect sleep, cross-ethnic differences in sleep patterns may have potential implications for the treatment and prevention of psychopathology.

Bonner II, Aretha F. Marbley, and Mary F. Howard-Hamilton (Eds.) (2011). The term Millennial is often used to describe the cohort born in the early 1980s to late 1990s many of whom entered college following the year 2000. As numerous authors in this edited book point out, the very attempt to use a single term to capture an entire generation of students is inherently inadequate, given the vast diversity of the student population. Furthermore, the images and trends evoked by the Millennial label can fall short in showcasing the range of experiences between and within key student sub-populations. This edited volume seeks to remedy some of these issues by providing a more complex and nuanced depiction of the diversity of the Millennial generation. Chapter 1 discusses assumptions about Millennial. Chapters 2 and 3 provide two perspectives on Black Millennial students. Chapters 4 and 5 address facets of experiences related to Asian American and Pacific Islander Millennials, although the chapters focus more on Asian American rather than Pacific Islander students. In chapter 6, the authors use data from the UCLA Higher Education Research Institute's Cooperative Institutional Research Program to compare cohorts of Latino/a Millennials over the generations. Chapter 10 overviews key issues related to LGBTQ Millenials.

It is important to note that the book focuses on acculturating into American (and to some extent Canadian) culture. Although some of the themes in the book may be relevant for a global readership (for example, the impact differences in language, religion, and social status have on the ability to acculturate), the majority of research presented is limited to minority populations of the United States and Canada, specifically people from Asian decent, Latinos, African Americans, and to a lesser degree American Indians. The book is comprised of four parts, which take the reader from a conceptual understanding of acculturation, including an overview of relevant research, to a more applied focus in the latter chapters of the text.

Their topics cover general concepts, psychometric challenges, identity, values, and family. The last five chapters encompass health psychology and abnormal psychology from an acculturation perspective. These chapters are more data-focused, with 12 tables and only one figure of a model of health and illness. Some chapters address enculturation for minority groups rather than acculturation, although these authors use the term acculturation rather than enculturation. This book should prove interesting and perhaps helpful to several groups of psychiatrists. Those working with immigrants, refugees, and internal migrants (e.g., rural-to-urban migrants) will confirm many of their clinical hunches and perhaps broaden their conceptual horizons regarding migration and its concomitants. Cultural psychiatrists early in their careers will find the volume an excellent entree to recent work on acculturation, particularly the work performed by cultural psychologists.

This book presents an argument about the idea of an economically powerful and culturally robust India rides on the backs of a relatively small group of information technology (IT) professionals in the country. The data for this book are based on an ethnographic, multisite study of the lives of Indian IT professionals, primarily engineers, working in software and hardware sectors in India and the United States. The author is at her best when she shows that for IT professionals protecting the family actually means preserving gender roles and family arrangements that constitute their privileged backgrounds. This book is a strong rebuttal to the popular argument that neoliberal economic policies have opened the doors of opportunity for all. Instead it offers important insights into how local cultures and internal hierarchies shape the nature of cultural and economic globalization. The only dissatisfying part of the book was the section on religion. The reader has to wait to find out that a key concern of the book is examining how Hindu ideologies impact the transnational class, which in the end is subjected to only a few pages of analysis. Nevertheless, this is an exceptionally well written and theoretically rich book that will be a great addition to graduate and upper-level undergraduate courses on transnationalism, globalization, culture, development, sociological theories, or South Asian studies.

In this book the author investigated the relationships between seven Chinese-Canadian families, eight Chinese-Canadian students, and two Euro-Canadian teachers at the Taylor Elementary School in Richmond, a predominantly middle-class Chinese neighborhood in the greater Vancouver area. Her findings revealed cultural clashes and symbolic struggles between Euro-Canadian teachers and Chinese-Canadian immigrant parents. The conflicts centered on the school's methods of literacy instruction. The Chinese-Canadian parents preferred traditional, teacher-centered, code-emphasis education. Li saw the conflict between Euro-Canadian teachers and Chinese-Canadian parents through the narrow prism of culture. Consequently, her solution was culturally sensitive pedagogy. Although it has merit, it is too narrow to solve the problem. To solve the problem, the solution must go beyond this.

The book also helps the reader to begin to understand his or her implicit theories about certain situations and asks the reader to consider how different cultural contexts may influence interpretations of various situations. The end product of this book is that it is very readable and thought provoking.

The only difficulty that I have with this book is that it relies too heavily on using only one perspective—the structural approach. While this perspective is fairly broad in scope by including economic, demographic, and historical-legal factors, I believe that this book would benefit greatly by incorporating theories relating to feminism, and/or to power, domination and exploitation.

According to Nemoto, most white men filter their relationships with Asian women through a lens of color-blindness and multiculturalism, in which the race of their partner is understood as a matter of culture and appearance and the increase in intermarriage is heralded as evidence of America’s racial progress. The insight here is that seemingly private emotions, such as desire, anxiety, and repulsion, are deeply gendered and racialized. This is where the book does not quite deliver. Although Nemoto emphasizes that interracial romance is constituted by and constitutive of gendered, sexualized, and racialized discourses and practices that circulate between Asia and the United States, this critical stance is not tightly grafted to the respondents’ personal narratives. This book gives not only an unfinished feel, but also de-contextualizes and de-historicizes these life stories, making it difficult to grasp the connection between desire, social structure, and power that Nemoto clearly wants us to see.

Review of Sexual cultures in East Asia: The social construction of sexuality and sexual risk in a time of AIDS.,"Ingham, Roger",Sex Education,14681811,,20050201,5,1,105,2,2005-04117-008,,Taylor & Francis,Review-Book,AIDS; Culture (Anthropological); Sexual Risk Taking; Sexuality; Sociocultural Factors; Asians; Constructivism; Culture Change; Modernization; Prostitution; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Traditions; Values,,"Reviews 'Sexual cultures in East Asia: The social construction of sexuality and sexual risk in a time of AIDS' (2004). This book arises mainly from papers presented at the International Institute for Asian Studies conference held in Amsterdam in 2000. The authors are a mix of social and medical anthropologists, historians, sociologists, communication specialists, medical doctors and a development expert, with a good mix of Europeans and East Asians; the various papers report the results of a three-year research project funded by the European Science Foundation. The first part of the book deals with Sexual cultures: caught between traditions and transitions, with chapters on sex work of one kind or another in China, Japan, Vietnam and Cambodia. The chapters illustrate very well the value of a detailed understanding of what drives sex work, as well as how changes in such activity provide some insights into the impact of globalization in these countries. The second part of the collection--The social construction of sexual risk in the light of STDs/AIDS control--contains chapters on Republican Shanghai, Taiwan and Vietnam. Whilst all the chapters in this volume are of great interest, and raise issues of conflict between traditional values and modern changes, the final chapter is, in my view, the most provocative. Wolffers et al. disentangle the notion of traditional 'cultural' values, and present a powerful and cogent case that such values serve to privilege men in many Asian societies. If I have a criticism of the volume, it is that this fundamental issue is not discussed further. Given that the chapters emanate from a coordinated research programme, and many were presented at a conference, then I would like to have read rather more about the discussions between the participants, especially since they are drawn from both the West and the East.

This book was originally published as a special issue in the journal South Asian Popular Culture. In their opening introduction, the editors are quick to dismiss the notion that sport and being South Asian do not mix. They argue that the spaces and practices of sport are, and have always been, important features of South Asian identities and cultural pastimes. Central to the editors’ understanding of sport and being South Asian is the concept of diaspora. key strength of this book is that the relationship between sport and being South Asian is never taken-for-granted. Many of the chapters in this book focus upon how sport is represented in and through popular cultural forms such as films, books, advertising and various media outlets. This book is a must read for sociologists of sport and more broadly, scholars of South Asian studies, theorists of race, ethnicity and gender, mass media and cultural studies researchers and writers.

The review focuses on the first two sections. The first section describes the psychometric properties of the FAST, explains the science behind the instrument, and compares it to other competing instruments. Section 2 focuses on the use of the FAST with non-clinical groups to identify different qualities of family systems, a process that accounts for the influence of multiple variables.

This monograph is valuable for the critical survey of previous investigations on the two problems studied and for the comparative data of the different races. The results of the three large groups (Whites, Indians, Filipinos) can be accepted with considerable confidence. Too few representatives of the other peoples were available to make the results final.

It includes a study of 74 business leaders, continue their investigation, to show the diversity and inclusion in the power elite. Secondary data to compile important demographics on the women, Latinos, African-Americans, and Asian Americans who have led major publicly traded corporations have been used. The authors draw on other research on leadership trends to place their stories in a context. While this new business era is characterized by a culture that rejects internal labor markets in search of charismatic leaders who can shake up companies, these women and racial-minority CEOs are more likely to be insiders who have proven themselves and are familiar with corporations before their selection by a board of directors. This book is sobering in how to shows us what many African-Americans corporate executives routinely say to each other about their corporations: 'Much has changed, but much as stayed the same'. The authors however need to get past the distractions and accept how this limited diversity has not really moved us forward as a nation.

Reflexivity is an important strategy to use when conducting qualitative studies, particularly one in which the researchers and study participants are from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. The authors, who were white British researchers, conducted a qualitative study (focus groups) to explore the experiences of internationally educated nurses working as healthcare assistants in the NHS as part of a programme to increase pathways to UK registration. The authors provide an example of how they used reflexive practice in order to appraise critically the qualitative data that they gathered in order to curtail bias and misinterpretation. The two researchers presented their reflective discussions as they worked through the tensions that arose during their analysis. The authors' goal was to enhance the accuracy of the research and the credibility of their findings by engaging themselves consciously and deliberately to think about how their own experiences and values may have impacted their interpretations.

Ss were 618 Euro-Americans, 475 Hispanics, 282 Asian Americans, and 474 Blacks. Using opposition to interracial marriage and dating as a case of a hierarchy-maintaining social attitude, the data were found to support the ideological asymmetry hypothesis.

The analysis reported in this study focuses on only junior high school students (Grades 7 to 9, N = 3,058). The results of a regression analysis show that gender, age, direct victimization, witness victimization, alcohol use, smoking, anger traits, lack of impulse control, attitudes toward violence, poor quality of student—teacher relationships, and involvement with at-risk peers were significantly associated with school violence in Taiwan. The overall results suggest strong similarities in risk factors found in the West and school violence in Taiwan.

The purpose of this research was to measure the prevalence of student risk factors and protective factors by race and ethnicity and assess the engagement of Asian youth in prevention services. Results indicated statistically significant racial and ethnic group differences in the prevalence of risk factors (self-reported depressive symptoms, substance use, externalizing behavior at school, failing grades, truancy, and discrimination by school adults and peers), and protective factors (school, home, and peer assets). Controlling for gender, family structure, risk behaviors, protective factors, and school composition, Black (OR = 2.31, p < .001), Latino (OR = 1.36, p < .05), and multiracial (OR = 1.42, p < .01) students had significantly higher odds of using their SBMH program than Asian students. Among Asian ethnic subgroups, Cambodian youth (OR = .62, p < .01), were the only group that had lower odds of accessing school-based services than their Chinese peers. Findings suggest that, to reach underserved Asian American adolescents, prevention programs must address cultural and contextual influences on adolescent help seeking when program outreach and enrollment strategies are being developed.

Moreover, motivated devaluation is expected to be stronger the closer the value construct is tied to the self. Multiple group structural equation models tested whether students’ self-concepts of their science ability differentially predicted the values students attach to science in Western and East Asian subsamples of the Programme for International Student Assessment. Science self-concept predicted value of science in all countries; however, the effects were stronger in Western than East Asian countries. Moreover, effects were stronger for the psychologically more proximal personal than for the more distal general value of science. Results are thus in line with the proposition that the value students attach to an academic domain in part results from a motivated process driven by their domain-specific self-concept of ability.

Aim: This research aims at examining whether self-attention mediates the influence of acculturation on changes in depressive symptoms in an immigrant group. Method: Adults of Asian cultural backgrounds were surveyed. Depressive symptoms were assessed and divided into three categories: affective, somatic and interpersonal items of depression. Acculturation experiences were measured. Self-attention to three aspects (i.e. affective, somatic and interpersonal) of the self was also assessed. Results: As acculturation proceeds, Asian immigrants tend to pay increasingly more attention to the affective aspect of the self and less to the somatic aspect of the self. The changes in the focus of self-attention seem to explain the changes in the experience of depression that include more affective and less somatic symptoms of depression as the degree of acculturation increases. Conclusion: Self-attention to certain aspects of the self seems to play an important role mediating the influence of acculturation on changes in subcategories of depressive symptoms.

Ethnic representation included African American, Chinese, Filipino, other Asian/Pacific Islander, Latino, and European American. Over half of this sample of teens were sexually active by the age of 14, with sexually active teens and substance-abusing teens scoring higher on HIV knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding HIV-related behaviors. Ethnicity consistently appeared more significant in predicting these risk behaviors than gender, self-efficacy, and knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. The predominance of ethnicity as the predictor for these HIV risk behaviors indicates that theoretical models for behavior change must include a dimension of culture, diversity, and ethnic identity.

Previous research suggests that the association between parent–child relationships and offspring’s academic achievement may be mediated by offspring’s self-efficacy levels, although these relationships are not fully understood. Furthermore, the association between family support and academic outcomes is well-documented among European Americans, but not across cultures. Therefore, the present study examined how parent–child relationship quality relates to young adults’ academic achievement and self-efficacy among European Americans and Asian Americans. Participants were 258 undergraduate students (85 male, 173 female) who completed a survey. Overall, both parent–child relationships and self-efficacy were significantly associated with the offspring’s academic performance, and self-efficacy mediated the relationship between parent–child relationships and school outcomes. Ethnicity moderated these relationships: among European American students, quality of parent–child relationships was not associated with self-efficacy level whereas for Asian Americans, parent–child relationships were associated with self-efficacy. These findings suggest that European American college students’ self-efficacy levels are less dependent on parent–child relationship quality, but for Asian Americans college students it may be important for educators to facilitate communication and family support so students may continue to use family as a resource for self-efficacy levels.

In spite of the projected increase, Chinese American older patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders and their family caregivers have received insufficient attention in research. This study explored service barriers perceived by family caregivers and by service professionals in a U.S. Southwest metropolitan area where there are no organized Chinese communities. Focus groups were used to obtain perceptions regarding service barriers and strategies to overcome these barriers. Content analysis was used to identify themes that were transcribed from the focus group information session. Similar to previous research, this study identified shortages of culturally-competent services, stigma, caregivers’ limited knowledge of the health care system, and lack of initiative to seek professional help as service barriers. In contrast to prior work, lack of communication concordance was identified as a major barrier in client-professional interactions, including professionals’ insufficient understanding of the Chinese language and culture, patient and family tendencies to minimize issues in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders, and incongruent expectations that health professionals and Chinese patients have for one another. Educating Chinese family members, the young generation in particular, and developing community resources for Chinese American families coping with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders are recommended as methods to remove service barriers. Findings were further discussed within a practice-oriented framework to provide implications for gerontological practice.

Despite recognition of the risks of unplanned pregnancy and disease transmission, the use of contraceptives and/or prophylactics among young sexually active Filipinas in Australia is inconsistent. While this does not set them apart from Australian-born young people, sexual expression is influenced by cultural values of both the immigrant family and dominant community. Young migrant women experience particular barriers in discussing sex with their parents or other community members, because of their concern with family honour and shame and tensions related to differences in values between the host and origin cultures.

Asian participants also indicated their levels of American acculturation and Asian cultural affiliation. The study found significant evidence of sexual double standards in both Whites and Asians, with certain ethnically different patterns. Whites and Asians did not differ significantly in their levels of sexual double standards when it concerned casual sexual and multiple sexual partners at the same time. However, Asians expressed stronger support for double standards than Whites when evaluating people for taking the initiative in sex and for having a large accumulated number of sexual partners. In both ethnic groups, men demonstrated stronger double standards than did women. Both Whites and Asians, regardless of gender, reported more conservative sexual attitudes for choosing marriage partners than in judging people in general. In the case of Asians, American acculturation and Asian cultural affiliation had limited and gender-specific effects on endorsement of sexual double standards. This study not only addresses an important gap in the sexual double standards literature but also brings new insights to the general discussion of ethnic differences in sexual attitudes.

For gay men of color, such beliefs may differentially influence their sexual preferences. Yet, little is known about the social-psychological factors underlying differences in sexual preferences among gay men of color. The present study examined how personal preferences for social hierarchy and dominance may explain variations in sexual positioning preferences, and how this relationship may be further qualified by their race-based sexual attraction among gay Asian/Pacific Islander (API) men. A total of 141 API gay men were recruited to participate in an online survey. Measures assessed participants’ sexual positioning preferences, race-based sexual attraction, and preferences for social hierarchy or social dominance orientation (SDO). Self-identified tops scored higher on SDO than bottoms or versatiles. Participants attracted to non-API men scored higher on SDO compared to participants attracted to API men and participants who reported no race-based attraction. Finally, a significant two-way interaction indicated that tops attracted to non-API men scored the highest on SDO, and bottoms with no race-based attraction in men scored the lowest. Race/ethnicity is a prominent factor in sexual attraction and sexual positioning preferences among gay men, and one’s proclivity for social hierarchy and dominance explains differences in sexual preferences among API gay men. By demonstrating how API gay men negotiate sexual preferences, present findings help elucidate existing race-based sexual dynamics within gay male culture.

It was found that reading in the mother tongue played only a small part in the lives of the majority of respondents. It is argued, therefore, that the dominance of Anglo-American culture in the lives of these students (and, indeed in the lives of bilingual adolescents across many parts of the world) places pressure on the home language and culture of bilingual adolescents to compete with the experience offered to them, at a time when they are already striving to form an individual identity.

The paper argues that the familial model is correct in conceiving the last journey of one's life as a sharing process rather than a process of exercising one's prior or counterfactual choice, and concludes by suggesting a policy framework for the practice of familialism that can answer the liberal challenge that familialism cannot safeguard the patient from abuse and neglect.

The East Asian socialization hypothesis proposed social anxiety would show a linear relation corresponding to the degree of exposure to East Asian cultural norms. This hypothesis was not supported. The cultural discrepancy hypothesis examined whether bicultural East Asian participants (residing in Canada) would endorse higher social anxiety in comparison to unicultural participants (Western-heritage Canadians and native Koreans and Chinese). Compared to unicultural participants, bicultural East Asian participants reported higher social anxiety and depression, a relation that was partially mediated by bicultural participants' reports of lower self-efficacy about initiating social relationships and lower perceived social status. Overall, the results suggest higher reports of social anxiety among bicultural East Asians may be conceptualized within the context of cultural discrepancy with the mainstream culture.

Asian American adults (N = 255) responded to an online survey, in which they completed measures of the Big Five traits (BFI; Benet-Martínez & John, 1998), Bicultural Identity Integration (BIIS-1; Benet-Martínez & Haritatos, 2005), acculturation and enculturation (AAMAS; Chung, Kim, & Abreu, 2004), and social anxiety (SIAS; Mattick & Clarke, 1998). As hypothesized, the acculturation/enculturation and BII constructs (BII-Conflict and BII-Distance) were fairly independent. When only cultural variables were considered, acculturation and BII-Conflict were comparable predictors of social anxiety. However, only BII-Conflict, and not BII-Distance or acculturation/enculturation, contributed incremental prediction of social anxiety beyond the Big Five traits. An integrated model—in which selected Big Five traits predicted acculturation/enculturation and BII, which, in turn, predicted social anxiety—fit the data well.

Results indicated that the effect of acculturation on SWB was mediated by social connectedness in mainstream and ethnic communities and expected social status, whereas the effect of enculturation on SWB was mediated by social connectedness in the ethnic community and expected social status. Contrary to the authors' hypothesis, perceived discrimination did not mediate the relation of acculturation and SWB, but indirectly influenced SWB via a lowered sense of connectedness to mainstream society.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 132 12–13 yr olds from 4 ethnic groups attending secondary schools in 2 inner London boroughs and a follow-up interview was completed approximately 17 mo later. Data was analyzed using chi-square and McNemar tests. Familial, religious and peer influence closely correlated with ethnicity. Bangladeshi Ss showed lower levels of peer and higher levels of religious and familial involvement and lower levels of substance use. White Ss reported higher levels of peer, lower levels of religious and familial involvement, and a higher level of substance use. Black African and Black Caribbean Ss fell between the 2 extremes. The findings suggest that young people with lower levels of familial and religious influence, or higher levels of peer influence, have higher levels of substance consumption than other young people.

Data used were from a pilot survey of Salvadorean and Pilipino immigrants in 2 Los Angeles communities. Analyses were conducted with probit models and ordinary least squares regression models corrected for selection. The findings, unlike those in many previous studies, show that strong social ties, such as family ties, affect employment status and wages. The effects, however, differ by gender. Among men, working with relatives is associated with higher wages. Among women, having non-coresident relatives in the US is associated with higher wages. The latter finding is most plausibly a social-network effect among Salvadorean women, who live in a working-class community. These findings suggest that social ties are important determinants of the wage-earning potential of immigrants, and that the effects of social ties depend on community characteristics such as social-class composition.

This study was designed to develop and validate a socially and culturally appropriate lexicon for Asian-Indians who use AAC. Method: To this end, 120 individuals from India participated in this study. A composite list of lexical items was identified, using a structured social validation technique involving non-categorical and categorical nominations, and a rating of lexical items from a Picture Communication Symbols (PCS) lexicon. Results: Data analysis indicated that 88 lexical items from the nomination task were not represented in the PCS lexicon and 247 items were rated as having no value for the Asian-Indian culture. Conclusions: Findings suggest that while a lexicon from symbol sets developed for one culture might have considerable overlap across cultures, these lexicons may not be appropriate as a source of selecting a lexicon for an AAC user from a culturally and linguistically diverse background.

Measurement and temporal invariance of these constructs was first established before testing the proposed model across the samples. Across the three samples, 10th-grade SPD had significant effects on 10th-grade work salience and vocational expectations; 12th-grade SPD had a significant effect on 12th-grade work salience.

Explanations about the causes of breast cancer involved 5 domains of belief. The first domain was of a physical nature and centered on damage to the breast. A second domain of explanations, 'can catch it,' focused on the way this disease could be spread to others. Other women attributed breast cancer to the ways women could 'bring it upon yourself,' often linking a negative lifestyle with the development of cancer. Many women attributed cancer to being 'in the hands of others,' explaining the cancer was caused by careless words, curses or divine power. Finally, breast cancer was seen as something that could be passed down in the family.

Although central cities have made the transition to a majority-minority configuration, suburbs are still overwhelmingly white. Levels of minority-white segregation are nonetheless lower in suburbs than in cities. Blacks remain the most segregated group at both locations. Black segregation and isolation levels are declining in cities and suburbs; however, while Hispanic and Asian segregation levels have remained stable, spatial isolation levels have risen. Multivariate analyses suggest that Hispanics achieve desegregation indirectly by using socio-economic achievements to gain access to less-segregated suburban communities and directly by translating their status attainments into residence in white neighbourhoods. Blacks do not achieve desegregation indirectly through suburbanization and they are much less able than Hispanics to use their socio-economic attainments directly to enter white neighbourhoods.

In support of the hypotheses, dispositionally or situationally modest Chinese participants manifested low explicit self-esteem while manifesting high implicit self-esteem. Modesty among American participants constrained explicit self-esteem but yielded no associations with implicit self-esteem.

From in-depth interviews with seven Taiwanese immigrant mothers, it was learned that they viewed these settings positively, even though their children were not in cultural environments that mirrored their homes and ethnic communities. Mothers explained that they purposefully chose this type of setting because 1) they desired to develop their children's social competency in U.S. society; 2) they perceived U.S. childcare settings as multicultural and accepting of diverse cultures even if they were in the minority; and 3) they were confident that their children's participation in their own Taiwanese ethnic community would ensure the maintenance of their children's ethnic identity and knowledge of their parents' culture. For these reasons, they did not seek out race matching or cultural congruity between childcare centers and their homes. Instead, mothers viewed the childcare center as part of their overall socialization strategy for developing their children's bicultural competency in both their heritage culture as well as U.S. society.

The stress in the paper is on the formative nature of language in lending form to ourselves from the disorderly flow of everyday talk and practice. It is argued that the girls construct reflexive identities in 2 grammatical forms. Identities are instanciated in the flow of language as well as in the self-narrative of 'I.' The author is centrally concerned with the production of multiple, hybrid identities among British Asian girls. They see themselves as Asian yet distance themselves from aspects of tradition by virtue of their participation in other domains of British culture. They are both in and out of British society and Asian culture. These identities are complicated by gender relations so that ethnic and gender identities cross-cut or dislocate each other.

Based on three-factor model of relationship qualities, the present research examined how indicators of relationship quality would be associated with psychological outcomes and how such associations would be mediated by the tendency of support seeking in a heterosexual dating relationship among college students from Mainland China (Study 1), and Hong Kong and the United States (Study 2). Study 1 found that relationship depth was associated with the willingness of support seeking and life satisfaction through the tendency of support seeking among Mainland Chinese. Study 2 showed that relationship satisfaction had stronger associations with the likelihood of support seeking among Hong Kong Chinese than among Americans, but perceived support and conflict had stronger associations with support seeking among Americans than among Hong Kong Chinese.

Analyses of a nationally representative sample of 8th-grade students have indicated that families from East Asian origins invest more aggressively in financial, human, and within-family social capital than families from other racial groups, even after social and demographic controls are taken into consideration. These differences in investment explain a large portion of the Asian effect. In addition, half of the investment measures examined yield a greater educational return for East-Asian students than for students of other racial groups.

A questionnaire administered to 205 students (aged 16–53 yrs): 104 Pākehā (New Zealanders of European descent) students with English as a 1st language, and 37 Asian and 13 Polynesian students with English as a 2nd or other language. Data indicate that the Asian students had more frequent concerns with interactions with lecturers and making friends than the Pākehā students, and rated themselves as less competent in a number of study skills. The Pākehā students favored being taught within streamed groups and classes more than the other 2 ethnic groups. The differences between the responses of males and females were of a lesser magnitude than the differences between the ethnic groups; however females were more reticent than males about approaching lecturers for help and asking questions of them in class. The patterns of differences between the ethnic groups were interpreted as a function of technical competency in English and cultures of learning. The implications of the findings for instruction and the marketing of education as an export commodity are discussed.

Method: The sample consisted of 392 undergraduate females and 368 undergraduate males for a total of 760 individuals. Disordered eating pathology, body dissatisfaction, and maternal criticism were assessed in 484 White, 134 Latinx, and 142 Asian American undergraduates. Hierarchical regression, correlation, and t-test analyses were conducted for each ethnic group. Results: Among all three groups, body dissatisfaction, maternal criticism, and gender were significantly associated with disordered eating pathology. In addition, disordered eating and maternal criticism were greater among female undergraduates than among male undergraduates across all groups. However, body dissatisfaction did not differ significantly between female and male undergraduates in any of the three racial and ethnic groups. Findings from this study suggest that individual body dissatisfaction and maternal criticism may be differentially linked with disordered eating pathology across racial and ethnic groups. Among Whites and Latinx, body dissatisfaction was more strongly associated with disordered eating pathology than was perceived maternal criticism. However, among Asian Americans, perceived maternal criticism was more strongly associated with disordered eating pathology than was body dissatisfaction. Conclusions: Maternal criticism was the most saliently linked with disordered eating pathology among Asian Americans. Findings from this study speak to individual and familial factors impacting disordered eating across racial and ethnic groups. Additionally, this study highlights the potential role of culture on disordered eating, particularly self-construal and collectivistic and individualistic orientations.

In this study parenting styles (i.e. warmth, control and guan/training) and proactive and reactive aggression were assessed in a large sample of school children in Hong Kong, China (N = 4,175, mean age = 11.75). We found that: (a) both low warmth (in boys only) and guan (i.e. high expectation and close supervision, in both boys and girls) were associated with elevated parent‐reported proactive aggression, (b) high restrictive control (i.e. dominating and rejecting) was associated with high reactive aggression (in both boys and girls) based on parent‐ or child‐report data, and with high proactive aggression (in boys only) based on parent‐report data, and (c) guan was also positively associated with parent‐reported reactive aggression.

This study examined how national context and individual subjective well-being are associated with emerging adults’ marriage expectations in three Asian countries—South Korea, China, and Vietnam—which share the traditional Confucian marriage norms but differ in the degree of industrialization. Methods: Using convenience sampling, data came from 1,019 never-married college students living in the cities of Korea, China, and Vietnam. Results: The majority of the participants across the three countries had marriage intentions. The higher the subjective well-being, the more likely the participants were to have marriage intentions, and the earlier the expected marriage age. Cross-country difference was observed such that emerging adults from Korea were more likely to expect later marriage age than their counterparts from China and Vietnam. There was also gender difference in the association between subjective well-being and expected marriage age; the negative association between subjective well-being and expected marriage age was found for men, but not for women. Conclusions: The current study provides empirical evidence that national context and subjective well-being are associated with emerging adults’ expectations about future marriage. Given that higher subjective well-being was associated with more intentions to marry and an earlier expected marriage age beyond the national context, enhancing individual well-being through mental health promotions could be an effective pro-marriage policy.

Results indicate that these measures have similar effects on these diverse groups: bilingual students are less likely to drop out than English-only speakers, students in bilingual households are less likely to drop out than those in English-dominant or English-limited households, and students in immigrant households are less likely to drop out than those in nonimmigrant households. These findings suggest that those who enjoy the greatest educational success are not those who have abandoned their ethnic cultures and are most acculturated. Rather, bicultural youths who can draw resources from both the immigrant community and mainstream society are best situated to enjoy educational success.

Across three studies, feedback indicating that non-Black participants would respond with racial bias in interactions with Black people resulted in anxiety and the desire to avoid the interaction. In addition, when participants with an avoidance-focus interacted with a Black confederate (Study 2), they had shorter interactions that were rated as less pleasant by the confederate and participant as compared to those without an avoidance-focus. Avoidance-focused participants were less interested in future interactions and came across as more avoidant and biased to their partner than less avoidance-focused participants.

Chinese teachers appear to be controlling, but Chinese students do not have poor academic performance in international comparisons. The present study addressed this paradox by examining the cultural differences in students' interpretation of teacher controlling behaviors. Affective meanings of teacher controlling behaviors were solicited from 158 Chinese 5th graders and 115 American 5th graders. It was found that the same controlling behaviors of teachers had different affective meanings for different cultural groups (Chinese vs. American) and for groups with different levels of social–emotional relatedness with teachers (high vs. low). Chinese children perceived the behaviors as less controlling than American children and, in turn, reported that they were more motivated in their teachers' class than American children. Regardless of culture, children with high social–emotional relatedness with teachers perceived the behaviors as less controlling than children with low social–emotional relatedness with teachers. It was also found that internalization mediated the relation between social–emotional relatedness and children's learning motivation in both cultures. The findings revealed cultural differences as well as similarities in the psychological process of internalization.

It was found that, overall, low levels of satisfaction with physical appearance, high levels of parental overprotection, and high levels of perceived pressure from best female friends to lose weight predicted greater eating pathology in both acculturated and traditional women.

In order to prepare PR students in various parts of the world to become effective multicultural professionals it is essential for experiences and perspectives from other continents to be integrated into PR education. The complexities of societal factors such as culture, political systems and media systems make Asia a challenging place to conduct strategic PR. It is time for educators to integrate experiences from other continents into the PR body of knowledge, thereby building PR curricula that contribute to training truly multicultural PR professionals.

Experiment 1 investigated the impact of stories of individual success on stereotypes of African Americans. Experiment 2 examined the effect of information about Asian American success on the stereotyping of Mexican Americans. In both studies, observations of the attainments of select groups and individuals contributed to the negative stereotyping of disadvantaged groups. The studies also examined the processes through which comparative status information affects stereotypes. As expected, information about the success of some persons contributed to the stereotyping of others by altering beliefs about opportunity in society, which, in turn, influenced the attributions that were made for the positions and roles of the target group. Thus, social mobility beliefs and attributions of group status were shown to be important determinants of stereotypes that can mediate the impact of social status information on stereotyping. The findings suggest that there may be important unwanted consequences to the commonplace stories of individual attainment and Asian American success that frequent the popular media.

These more permanent return migrations reveal strategies of local and global assertions of belonging and identity management among the '1.5' and second generation of Vietnamese Americans who work in high-skilled professions in their parents’ ancestral homeland. Known there as the Viet Kieu (Overseas Vietnamese), those who work in both corporate and nongovernmental organizations draw upon multiple forms of social and cultural capital to negotiate a third space between the local and global in Westernizing pockets of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I argue that Viet Kieu constructed symbolic boundaries to distinguish themselves from foreigners and ethno-national boundaries to distinguish themselves from locals, but they also crossed these boundaries to find spaces of belonging in Vietnam. The experiences of this niche subgroup of more skilled Viet Kieu constitute 'transnational' instances of active ethnic and national identity renegotiation that reaffirmed the importance of place making and subjective claims to an imagined authentic return experience. This study focused on highly skilled returnees, aiming to analyze how transnational flows of capital such as language, education, and access played into the symbolic boundary making and identity politics of return.

Five years previously, preparation for creation of the ICPM-AC was started at the 4th World Congress of the International College of Psychosomatic Medicine (ICPM) held in Kyoto, Japan, September 5-9, 1977. The First Congress of the ICPM-AC was held by the President Yujiro IKEMI in Tokyo on May 19-20, 1984. The main members in the early stage were Y. IKEMI, H. ISHIKAWA, S. TSUTSUI, Taisaku KATSURA, Tetsuya NAKAGAWA. Hiroyuki SUEMATSU and others from Japan and Hsien RIN (Taiwan), Seock Young KANG (Korea), M. MAHADEVAN. B. G. BURTON-BRADLEY and others from other Asian countries. Thereafter, academic congresses of the ICPM-AC, the 2nd to the 9th, were held approximately every two years, in Japan, India, Malaysia, Taiwan, Korea, and China. The name was changed to the Asian College of Psychosomatic Medicine (ACPM), and the 10th to 14th congresses were held in Taiwan, Okinawa (Japan), Australia, Korea, and China. The current president of the Executive Board of ACPM is Chiharu KUBO, the Director of Kyushu University Hospital. The next academic congress is the 15th ACPM and will be hosted by Tserenkhuugyin LKHAGVASUREN in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia from August 24-26, 2012.

For young working-class South Asian women, Hindus and Sikhs also regarded religion as less significant in their lives, but for Muslims it was again seen as crucial--but certain practices were argued to be more cultural than religious, and thereby problematic. For some young South Asian Muslim women, it leads to further marginalization in education, given that they also originate from lower social class positions.

It consisted of six 1-hr long telephone-delivered sessions conducted by a mental health provider using a translated version of the Freedom from Problem Gambling Self-Help Workbook.

One-hundred and 40 callers inquired about the intervention within the first 6 months of its launch, 19 clients expressed interest in participating, and 8 enrolled into the program. The results show that the majority of clients who enrolled into the program did not report any gambling behavior after baseline and improved on self-reported measures of overall life satisfaction, gambling urges, and self-control. This study suggests that the implementation of this type of intervention is feasible at a small community-based organization and may be effective in treating gambling-related disorders for Asian American populations.

These difficulties are traced to the significant psychological impact of migration on IMGs, IMGs' cultural conflicts in using English as a second language, and to the differing attitudes towards mental illness in Eastern and Western cultures. To further delineate the Asian-Indian IMGs cultural hurdles in learning psychiatry, the impact of the Hindu world view on their individual psychologies and their interpersonal relationships is discussed. It is argued that the instructors involved in training IMGs must be conversant with these core-cultural differences of their trainees in order to better discharge their roles as teachers.

Twenty older adolescents (ages 16—19) and their mothers, from Chinese and Korean heritage, living in the Southern Bay area in California participated in the study. The main form of data collection was through formal, in-depth and open-ended interviews and administration of standardized emotional intelligence questionnaires. The findings suggest that East Asian beliefs in hierarchy in family order, ‘saving face’, hard work/education, respect for elders and sibling relations have an impact on parent/child interaction. In addition, acculturation and globalization contributed to the change in cultural norms. The repeating themes related to parenting practices were correlated with very low, low, medium and high emotional intelligence levels. Distinct attitudinal and perceptual differences between adolescents with very low and high EQ were found.

Recent research has explored mechanisms underlying such cultural differences, which indicate that participating in different social practices leads to both chronic as well as temporary shifts in perception. These findings establish a dynamic relationship between the cultural context and perceptual processes.

However, the most significant key finding was that in the ethnic minority sample high levels of culture identity were associated with heavy drug use.

Ward and W. Searle, 1991). The participants were 175 Asian international students from Japan, the People's Republic of China, South Korea, and Taiwan. It was hypothesized that a close fit between sojourners' self construals and the self construal that predominates in the host culture predicts sojourners' psychological adjustment. Similarly, it was hypothesized that a close fit between sojourners' and host nationals' communication styles predicts sojourners' sociocultural adjustment. The independent self construal, the prototypical self construal in the host culture, predicted psychological adjustment. The interdependent self construal was not related to psychological adjustment. Use of direct communication and positive perceptions of silence, prototypical communication styles in the host culture, were related to sociocultural adjustment and consistent with expectations. In addition, sensitivity to others' behavior predicted sociocultural adjustment.

The author explores variation in the performance of body labor caused by the intersection of the gendered processes of beauty service work with the racialized and class-specific service expectations of diverse customers. The study examines three distinct patterns of service provision that are shaped by racial and class inequalities between women: (1) high-service body labor, (2) expressive body labor, and (3 )routinized body labor. These patterns demonstrate that a caring, attentive style of emotional display is dominant in workplaces governed by white, middle-class 'feeling rules' but that different racial and class locations call forth other forms of gendered emotional management that focus on displaying respect, reciprocity, fairness, competence, and efficiency.

A qualitative descriptive study was undertaken to interview 11 older adults ages 64–92 in a day centre. In 2011, the data were collected and analysed by thematic analysis. Four interrelated themes indicated a rich meaning of life and health experience from the older adults: (i) happiness lies in contentment; (ii) sense of responsibility; (iii) letting nature take its course; (iv) and proactive self‐balance. These interrelated themes with partial conflict presented a dialectic meaning of life and were interpreted from traditional Chinese culture and compared with positive health philosophy.

We begin by examining likely causes for alienation that occur as a result of immigration to the United States. We then present the cultural context of Asian American families that can also serve to create distance between parent and child, including the contrasting cultural orientations of individualism and collectivism, Asian traditional values, differences in Eastern and Western parenting styles, and intergenerational cultural dissonance. Next, we present a review of the research that has examined acculturation as a risk factor for alcohol use and abuse among Asian American adolescents, with special attention to the mediating role of parent–child bonding.

Methods: Ninety-six Chinese American breast cancer survivors completed a questionnaire package assessing AEE and pain. Results: AEE was positively associated with pain severity and pain interference. The association between AEE and pain interference was mediated by intrusive thoughts. Conclusion: Cancer survivors who are ambivalent over emotional expression may experience high levels of intrusive thoughts, which results in high levels of symptom reports in their pain. The study confirmed the association between AEE and pain and its underlying mechanism among a group whose culture generally encourages emotional suppression.

Yet people continue to face and reflect on moral dilemmas throughout the life-course. This article examines how a group of older women and men from a rural New York community deal with issues of meaning and purpose in their mature years, and compares their experiences with those of elders from India. Through a series of ethnographic vignettes, three American approaches to the moral nature of late life are explored: viz., deep involvement in art, in public service, and in self-exploration. Rural people discovered many forms of passion, ranging from the personal, professional and political to the ethical and expressive. In their attempts to negotiate both passion and purpose, these individuals also found themselves contending with major contradictions in their own culture, especially the tensions between self fulfillment and social responsibility, duty and creativity, and personal meaning and reciprocity. Their sense of purpose is compared with that of sannyasins, older spiritual seekers from India, whose goals stressed a very distinct set of cultural ideals.

This article argues that the Muslim terrorist in our popular culture should not be seen as new but within an established tradition of racializing Asian Americans. The article employs three dimensions of racialization: raced body, racial category, and ascribed subordination. The raced body is the 'brown' body of immigrants and descendants of immigrants from North Africa, the Middle East, and Central and Southern Asia. 'Muslim' as a racial category has acquired meaning beyond religion and now also describes a racial category: those whose ancestry traces to countries where Islam is significant. Linked to that category are the stereotypes of 'terrorist,' 'spy,' or 'saboteur'—understandings within the tradition of characterizing Asian Americans as permanent, unassimilable foreigners. Inscribing the linked racial category and ascribed subordination of permanent foreignness upon the 'brown' raced body is the racialization of Muslims into Muslim terrorists.

The purpose of this study was to (a) assess the existence and severity of reverse cultural shock in music therapy professionals from the Asia Pacific Rim area who relocated/established their professional practices at home after formal music therapy training in the United States, (b) understand their re-entry experience by exploring the relationships between reverse cultural shock and re-entry satisfaction, and (c) investigate the relationship between reverse cultural shock experienced and readaptation to home culture on a personal level. Forty-two music therapists accepted the invitation to participate in an on-line survey. Results revealed that most participants experienced low levels of reverse cultural shock during re-entry to their home country. The Pearson's Correlation Test found there was a medium-strong negative correlation between the severity of reverse cultural shock experienced and level of re-entry satisfaction, and weak negative correlation between re-adaptation to home culture on a personal level and severity of reverse cultural shock experienced. The transfer and application of music therapy knowledge and skills learned in the United States to the professional practice in participants' home cultural environment was also investigated.

White participants performed a gender identification task in which Asian, Black, and White faces were presented while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Participants also completed an implicit association task for Black (IAT-Black) and Asian (IAT-Asian) faces. ERPs evoked by Black and White faces differed, with Black faces evoking a larger positive ERP that peaked at 168 ms over the frontal scalp, and White faces evoking a larger negative ERP that peaked at 244 ms. These Black/White ERP differences significantly correlated with participants' scores on the IAT-Black. ERPs also differentiated White from Asian faces and a significant correlation was obtained between the White-Asian ERP difference waves at ~500 ms and the IAT-Asian. A positive ERP at 116 ms over occipital scalp differentiated all three races, but was not correlated with either IAT. In addition, a late positive component (around 592 ms) was greater for the same race compared to either other race faces, suggesting potentially more extended or deeper processing of the same race faces. Taken together, the ERP/IAT correlations observed for both other races indicate the influence of a race-sensitive evaluative process that may include early more automatic and/or implicit processes and relatively later more controlled processes.

Acculturation is speculated to be one of the sociocultural factors contributing to pain sensitivity since cultural beliefs and practices can influence the way patients perceive and respond to pain. However, the relationship of acculturation to pain sensitivity in minority populations remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this cross-sectional study, we examined the relationship between acculturation and experimental pain sensitivity in 50 Asian Americans residing in North Central Florida with knee osteoarthritis pain. The Suinn-Lew Asian Self Identity Acculturation Scale was used to assess acculturation, and multimodal quantitative sensory testing was performed to measure experimental sensitivity, including heat pain tolerance, pressure pain threshold, and punctate mechanical pain. Descriptive and regression analyses were performed. Participants’ mean age was 55.7 years, and about half of this sample were Korean American (56%). The participants had lived in the United States for 21 years on average. Regression analyses indicated that lower acculturation to American culture may contribute to greater experimental pain sensitivity. Asian Americans who were more acculturated to the American culture had higher heat pain tolerance (beta = 0.61, P = 0.01), higher pressure pain threshold (beta = 0.59, P = 0.02), and lower ratings of punctate mechanical pain (beta = −0.70, P < 0.01). These findings add to the literature regarding sociocultural factors associated with pain in Asian Americans; additional research with a larger and more diverse sample of Asian Americans is warranted for cross- validation.

Because these policies were enacted at different points in time, their concomitant social impact has not been simultaneous, with the result that these societies are at different stages of change. The goal of this current analysis is to examine the dimensions of external contact and respondents’ departures from Confucian values—for example, embracing individualism, a woman’s taking the initiative in expressing affection to a man, and permissiveness toward premarital sex—among unmarried adolescents and young adults in these three cities and the potential relationship between them. This will contribute to our understanding of contemporary Asian adolescents’ and young adults’ attitudes during different social transition periods, attitudes that are frequently contrary to traditional Confucian principles. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. The multicenter survey of 17,016 male and female adolescents and young adults aged 15–24 years from three cities with Confucian-influenced cultures—Shanghai, Hanoi, and Taipei—was conducted from May 2006 to January 2007 through face-to-face interviews coupled with computer-assisted self-interviews for sensitive questions; 16,554 unmarried respondents were included in this analysis. Binary logistic regression and general linear models were used to explore the associations between respondents’ external contact and their nontraditional attitudes. All the analyses were done through SAS 9.1. Results: There were significant differences in the positive association between respondents’ external contact and non-Confucian values among adolescents in the three cities. More respondents in Taipei and Shanghai had external contact and identified with nontraditional values than those in Hanoi. The percentages of respondents reporting non-Confucian values were the highest in Taipei and the lowest in Hanoi. The analysis presented significant associations between respondents’ exposure to Western culture and their adoption of nontraditional values across the three cities. Respondents who spoke Western languages and who preferred Western videos/actors/singers were more likely to exhibit Western individualism, concurrence with women taking the initiative in a romantic relationship with a man, and permissiveness toward premarital sexual behavior.

Evidence indicates that modern discriminatory behavior is often a product of brief, commonplace, and often subtle acts that convey derogatory messages to people of color, known as racial and ethnic microaggressions. Accurately measuring microaggression is essential to understanding and preventing behaviors that are consistent with this complex construct. The current study examines evidence for the reliability and validity of the Racial and Ethnic Microaggressions Scale (REMS). Data from a sample of 286 randomly selected Black, Latino/Hispanic, and Asian young adults (ages 18–35 years old) were used to examine the REMS. Exploratory factor analysis was used to assess the factor structure of the REMS across racial and ethnic groups. Findings support the reliability of the instrument but also suggest that a shorter 5-factor model offers a promising alternative to the original 6-factor instrument. Results also reveal differences between how members of different racial and ethnic groups conceptualize microaggression. Recommendations for using a revised version of the instrument (the Revised 28-Item REMS) and for future research aimed at optimally measuring microaggression are identified.

T. L. Leong and E. L.

Several of the hypotheses proposed by Leong and Chou were empirically tested in 2 separate studies. In Study 1, acculturation (R. M. Suinn, K. Rickard-Figueroa, S. Lew & P. Vigil, 1987) was found to be positively related to job satisfaction (A. H. Brayfield & H. F Rothe, 1951) and negatively related to occupational stress and strain (S. H. Osipow & A. R. Spokane, 1981) in a sample of 39 Asian American employees from 2 major companies who attended career development workshops. In Study 2, acculturation was found to be positively related to supervisors' performance ratings in a different sample of 27 Asian American employees. These preliminary data suggest that acculturation plays an important role in the career development of Asian Americans.

Faculty (N = 139) from four large public universities in California completed self-report surveys on mentoring, career satisfaction, and acculturation. Results suggest that the relationship generalizes to APIA faculty and that acculturation plays a role in the model, though not as hypothesized. Although acculturation did not moderate the relationship between mentoring and career satisfaction, it predicted mentoring (via an interaction) and career satisfaction (for participants born overseas) individually. Protégés using particular acculturation strategies reported a greater extent of mentoring from mentors of certain ethnic groups. In addition, participants who were born overseas and are more oriented to their API culture reported greater career satisfaction. Our results suggest that researchers should consider cultural variables, such as acculturation, when studying APIAs or when working with APIAs.

Logistic regression models examined the relationship between being Afro-Canadian and being brought to the emergency service by police or ambulance, while controlling for age, gender, marital status, and number of psychotic symptoms. Results: Of the 351 patients with psychosis, 59 percent were Euro- Canadian, 11 percent were Afro-Canadian, and 18 percent were Asian Canadian. Most Afro-Canadian patients in the study were immigrants from the Caribbean and Africa. Being Afro-Canadian was independently and positively associated with police or ambulance referral to emergency services.

The second study used a within-subject approach by using the strength of cultural identity of South Asian Canadians (n=92) as a predictor of preferred attributes. Both studies found a culture influence on 'traditional' mate attribute preferences. Moreover, familial cultural influence (e.g., family allocentrism) was a better mediator of the culture-traditional attribute preference relationship than the more generic measure of interdependent self-construal. The results further suggest that a cross-cultural approach, rather than a strength-of-cultural-identity approach, is better suited to tap into non-conscious influences of culture on behavior.

In addition, Study 2 demonstrated that Hong Kong Chinese memorized more pieces of information about a hypothetical enemy than did their Canadian counterparts, which demonstrated a greater concern about enemies among Hong Kong Chinese.

Study 1 established communication behaviors of Asians and New Zealanders (NZs) as consistent with vertical collectivism and horizontal individualism, respectively. In particular, argumentativeness is positively related to independent self-construal (SC) and negatively related to interdependent SC. This supports Markus and Kitayama’s SC theory. Study 2 showed that NZs exhibited more idiocentric and argumentative behavior, while Asians displayed more sociocentric and less argumentative behavior during two actual interactions; specifically, participants diverged in their communication styles to be more consistent with their cultural values during intercultural interactions. Analyses of decision outcomes provide support that culture moderates cognitive consistency behaviors such that NZs exhibited more inconsistency-reduction behaviors, which is rooted in adherence to noncontradiction. In contrast, Asians exhibited more inconsistency-support behaviors, suggesting that naive dialecticism rooted in acceptance of contradiction is customary in Asian social interaction.

Design: The sample comprised 166 Korean American adolescents (54.2% male), who were recruited from the Midwestern region of the United States. Adolescents’ ages ranged from 11-15 years old (M = 13.0 years; SD = 1.2). Cross-sectional data were collected via adolescent self-report questionnaires. Results: Results indicated that the anger regulation variables (either individually or collectively) mediated the influence of family processes (i.e., family conflict, family cohesion, and father-adolescent communication) on externalizing problems. Moreover, 2 indirect effects on externalizing problems were conditional upon adolescents’ independent self‐construal. Conclusions: These findings suggest that clinical intervention efforts for addressing externalizing problems may benefit from targeting anger regulation strategies. However, such interventions should be tailored to consider cultural context, since mediation effects may be moderated by cultural factors such as self‐construal.

EU reported higher frequency of heavy episodic drinking, alcohol-involved sex, and incapacitated sexual assault compared to API and NNES-API. In addition, API reported more frequent alcohol-involved sex and incapacitated sexual assault compared to NNES-API, in part due to API’s stronger endorsement of sexual disinhibition–related alcohol expectancies (indirect effects: β = −.04, p = .04, and β = −.07, p = .04, respectively).

Social constraints are the perception that social networks are unsupportive to stressor-related discussions. In the present study, the relationship between acculturative stress and psychological distress in Hispanic/Latino and Asian immigrants and the moderating role of social constraints in this relationship were examined. Method: Participants were 306 college students (169 Hispanics/Latinos, 137 Asians; 33.9% first-generation immigrants, 66.1% second-generation immigrants) from two Texas universities. Results: Correlation results showed that acculturative stress and social constraints were significantly associated with higher levels of psychological distress in Hispanics/Latinos and Asians. In addition, regression results indicated a significant three-way interaction effect among acculturative stress, social constraints, and racial/ethnic groups. Social constraints were found to moderate the relationship between acculturative stress and psychological distress in Asians but not in Hispanics/Latinos. Significant association between acculturative stress and psychological distress was found in Asians with higher levels of social constraints but not in Asians with lower levels of social constraints. Conclusions: These findings suggested that the interaction effect of acculturative stress and social constraints on psychological distress may be subject to cultural influences, and social constraints may have differential roles in Hispanics/Latinos and Asians.

Rather, the authors found evidence for the notion that higher achievement is predicted by both cultural universals as well as cultural specifics. Findings are discussed in terms of the culture and contexts of achievement.

Initial scale development and validation in the United States yielded a two-factor solution comprising anticipatory and consummatory pleasure. However, a four-factor model that further parsed anticipatory and consummatory pleasure experience into abstract and contextual components was a better model fit in China. In this study, we tested both models using confirmatory factor analysis in an American and a Chinese sample and examined the configural measurement invariance of both models across culture. We also examined the temporal stability of the four-factor model in the Chinese sample. The results indicated that the four-factor model of the TEPS was a better fit than the two-factor model in the Chinese sample. In contrast, both models fit the American sample, which also included many Asian American participants. The four-factor model fit both the Asian American and Chinese samples equally well. Finally, the four-factor model demonstrated good measurement and structural invariance across culture and time, suggesting that this model may be applicable in both cross-cultural and longitudinal studies.

Questionnaires were administered to 272 full-time MBA graduates from Asian, Arab and African countries soon after obtaining an MBA from UK business schools. The analysis reveals that leadership curricula on MBA programmes is broadly conceived in the US corpus and assumes universality. The ethnocentric approach to the teaching of leadership is due to a large extent to the unavailability of alternative theories and published empirical evidence outside the USA and the low level of faculty expertise and interest in international dimensions of effective leadership styles. The research argues that there is a need for western management schools to adopt a more eclectic view of leadership teaching and to cast their perspective beyond western idiosyncrasies and include non-western business perspectives.

Because Hispanics and Asians have ascended in this hierarchy, they arouse less threat and have more comfortable interactions with whites. Results from multilevel models of 2000 General Social Survey and Census data indicate that the real presence of blacks--not Hispanics or Asians--living near whites heightens whites' prejudice. Moreover, whites who know Hispanics and Asians are less prejudiced towards them, but whites need to both know and feel close to blacks to experience reduced prejudice. Implications are discussed.

The Parental Bonding Interview (FBI) has been very widely used, but not yet formally evaluated in a South Asian context. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the factor structure, face and concurrent validity of the PBI as an assessment of maternal bonding among young Pakistani women. Methods A total of 86 women, aged 20-35 years, were identified by door-knocking in two small catchment areas in Islamabad/Rawalpindi, one characterized by higher and one by lower socio-economic status. The PBI, the Clinical Interview Schedule Revised (CIS-R) and the Marital Satisfaction Scale (MSS) were each administered by a female interviewer in the respondent's home. Results All women agreed to be interviewed privately, the response rate was 100%. Consistent with previous reports, PBI items loaded on two well-characterized internally consistent scales, care and overprotection. In a three-factor solution, the overprotection scale divided into two subscales previously characterized as 'Encouragement of Behavioral Freedom' and 'Denial of Psychological Autonomy'. Concurrent validity was supported by correlations in the expected direction between PBI care and overprotection subscales and both psychological morbidity (CIS-R) and marital satisfaction (MSS). Conclusions Pakistani women seem to perceive and respond to PBI items as addressing parental 'control' or 'overprotection' in a similar way to respondents from western Anglophone cultures. This study provides further support for the core construct validity of the PBI, and indicates a perhaps surprising degree of sensitivity to cultural nuances.

But Tamil is acknowledged by many to be facing a number of crises. Tamil as a home language is not being maintained by the better educated, and Indian education in Singapore is also not living up to the expectations many people have for it. Further, because Tamil is a language characterized by extreme diglossia, there is the additional pedagogical problem of trying to maintain a language with 2 variants but with a strong cultural bias on the part of the educational establishment for maintaining the literary dialect to the detriment of the spoken one. This article examines these attempts to maintain a highly diglossic language in emigration and concludes that the well-meaning bilingual education system actually produces a situation of subtractive bilingualism.

Confucian ideas and the tradition of providing care to family members are central to cultures and these socio-cultural beliefs regarding family care in East Asian countries may seriously influence the experiences of family caregivers. This article reviews and draws conclusions from three Japanese and Korean studies that found that patients with schizophrenia are likely to isolate themselves from society, thus avoiding contact with nonfamily members and that these behaviors are correlated to a greater caregiver role and an increased caregiver burden. Japanese families of patients with schizophrenia are likely to perceive a stigma from others and are also likely to think that schizophrenia should be hidden from others in the community. Japanese families tend to adopt resignation as a strategy for coping with the strong stigma attached to schizophrenia. Additionally, Japanese families are more resistant to allowing others to care for family members with schizophrenia. Hence, there is a close tie between schizophrenia patients and their families. These findings suggest that Japanese mental health strategies should favor providing effective support for reducing caregiver burden and eliminating reliance on inappropriate coping strategies (i.e., resignation and unwillingness to accept support from outside the family) for family members of schizophrenia patients.

Aim: The purpose of this study was to test a hypothesized model that identified the effects of activity status, internal health locus of control, and resilience on Yangsaeng among patients with cardiovascular disease. Methods: Secondary data were utilized in this study. Originally, 543 Korean patients with cardio-vascular disease were recruited from general hospitals, although only 532 were included in this study. Path analysis was performed using AMOS 17.0. Results: Resilience was significantly associated with and accounted for 37% of the variance in Yangsaeng. Activity status and internal health locus of control were significantly associated with and accounted for 4% of the variance in resilience. Limitations: Given the cross-sectional data used, the sequencing and/or direction of the relationships found remains uncertain. There may be complex interactions that were not considered. Conclusions: These results suggest that enhancing resilience is essential to foster a health-promoting lifestyle that helps prevent the recurrence of cardio-vascular disease. Implications for nursing and health policy: Nurse development of a Yangsaeng program for patients with cardiovascular disease may be a useful means of enhancing resilience in western as well as eastern cultures. This will help such patients to recognize the health benefits of improving their resilience through heightened activity levels and adopting an internal health locus of control.

Included in the mix of different cultures are those who are living in the country temporarily. People who are transient may adhere to traditional health beliefs and practice and at the same time embrace the cultural life ways and beliefs of the host country.

Transnational community and its ethnic consequences: The return migration and the transformation of ethnicity of Japanese Peruvians.,"Takenaka, Ayumi",American Behavioral Scientist,00027642,,19990601,42,9,1459,16,1999-05255-006,10.1177/00027649921954994,Sage Publications,Journal Article,Acculturation; Communities; Ethnic Identity; Human Migration; Sociocultural Factors; Asians; Consequence; Adulthood (18 yrs & older),,"Investigated the consequences of transnational community formation for immigrants' communities and ethnic identity. Focusing on a culturally, nationally, and racially mixed group of 130 Japanese Peruvians (most of whom are aged 20–35 yrs) who are dispersed across Peru, Japan, and the US, the author examines how their communities and ethnic identity are transformed as a consequence of their migrations and transnational ties. During ethnographic fieldwork in their communities, the author found that Japanese Peruvians across the Pacific create their own ethnic identity as Nikkei, distinct from others, by exploiting their international ties and resources. It is argued that migrants' transnational ties can accentuate their group boundaries both within the sending and receiving countries, particularly when migrants perceive that there are benefits. Hence, the process of transnational community formation can hinder migrants' assimilation in nations.

Pole, J. P. Gone and M. Kulkarni (see record [rid]2008-02186-004[/rid]). Psychological trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affect persons and communities of all ethnocultural backgrounds. In light of the substantial evidence of intra- and intergroup diversity in the experience of psychological trauma and PTSD, it is essential first to reconsider the ways in which ethnocultural identity is defined and classified, in order to meaningfully study the relationship of race, ethnicity, and culture to the risk and adverse outcomes of psychological trauma. The role of racism as a risk factor for exposure to psychological trauma and PTSD, as well as a potential traumatic stressor with intergenerational effects, also requires careful study. Culturally competent psychological interventions to prevent or treat PTSD require informed practitioners who do not make stereotypic assumptions or inadvertently replicate racial biases.

Although these themes have unique relevance for each population, there are also some important commonalities. The first major theme reflects a common preference across diverse groups to develop a 'welcome message' for new clients that embraces cultural and traditional values of that particular culture. A second theme is that in addition to major differences between diverse ethnic groups, there are also important differences within each culture that need to be considered, including degree of assimilation into both minority and mainstream cultures, gender differences, and differences in belief about the etiology of certain disorders (e.g., biological, psychological, or cultural) and how they should be treated. The third major theme that emerges is that partnership and cooperation are the hallmarks of an integrated approach to our training, prevention, and treatment programs in cultures of diversity. A fourth and final theme described by most authors is the need to directly address the possibility that clients of diverse cultures have experienced racism and discrimination by others from mainstream or other ethnic minority populations. infection and continued drug use. In conclusion, one recommendation that emerges from this review is that when treatment first begins, both the therapist and client should take note of their own individual 'top-10 lists' so that common values and differences can be identified and discussed right from the beginning of the therapeutic relationship.

With the rise in ethnic minorities comes an increased demand for services and programs to serve and treat these individuals effectively. While disparities in mental health care have been noted, it is important to keep in mind that these findings are not universal. Many ethnic minority cultures are collectivist and seek support from their community and family members. This special series should provide readers with practical tools for working with persons with dual diagnoses in ethnic minority populations. While this compendium of articles focuses on the treatment for ethnic minorities, it should be remembered that diversity is represented in many facets, including class, gender, and sexual orientation, and that therapists should continue to develop a greater competency to work with all types of individuals.

The connection with extended family members such as grandparents can provide strength and resources for people of color, especially in child raising. In Troxel v. Granville , the Supreme Court made their decision largely on an individual rights basis rather than the 'greater good' or others' interpretation of the best interest of the child. The author reviews the family values reflected in Latina/o, Asian American, American Indian, and African American families. She suggests that when decisions such as Troxel v. Granville establish policy contrary to the lifestyles and values of ethnic minority populations, negative and insidious messages are sent about those groups' values.

The sample consisted of 493 college students from South Korea and the United States, with U.S. students divided between Asian Americans and European Americans. Results indicated that collectivism and individualism are best represented by a 4-factor model with the latent variables Kin Collectivism (KC), Kin Individualism (KI), Nonkin Collectivism (NC), and Nonkin Individualism (NI). KC and Kl were strongly inversely related, but NC and Nl were only moderately so. Whereas KC and NC were moderately related within each of the 3 student groups, Kl and Nl were moderately related only among Koreans and Asian Americans, and not among European Americans.

The role of religion, ethnicity, gender and generation in the uptake or avoidance of alcohol and tobacco was explored in 19 qualitative group and individual interviews with 47 Asians aged 16-26 years and analysed in terms of pioneering and conservative forms of tradition. Religious proscriptions on alcohol and tobacco were reported to be formally gender blind, but concerns about reputation and future marriage chances, sanctioned by gossip, meant that women's behaviour was consistently more constrained than men's. Muslims' abstinence from alcohol was tightly linked with an Islamic identity in that drinking jeopardised one's claim to being a Muslim, whereas cigarette smoking was tolerated among young men. Sikhs' and Hindus' avoidance of tobacco was strongly sanctioned, but smoking did not strongly jeopardise a religious identity. Sikh men's abstention indicated manly strength central to a devout identity. Some experimentation was possible out of view of the older generation, especially the aunties, but the risk of gossip damaging young women's reputations was keenly felt. While damage to women's reputations was hard to undo, men's reputations tarnished by substance use, could be compensated for by their parents' honourable status. Discussion of tradition as innovation was rare and met with resistance. Tradition was largely experienced as a constraint to be circumvented.

Participants considered situations in which another individual (1) failed to acknowledge or (2) appropriately acknowledged their national origin identity. Individuals in the neglect condition reported stronger negative emotions and partner evaluations. Conversely, participants in the recognition condition reported stronger positive emotions and partner evaluations. These effects generalized such that those who experienced neglect rated the partner’s ethnic group more negatively. The effects were stronger among those highly identified with their national origin group. Nearly all participants (91%) reported having experienced national origin identity neglect in daily life. These findings suggest that treating members of distinct social groups as interchangeable parts of a broader category, though seemingly benign, can elicit negative emotional responses and adversely affect intergroup relations.

Methods: Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, semistructured interviews were conducted with 8 Malaysian mothers from different ethnic backgrounds (4 Chinese, 3 Malays, and 1 Indian). Results: Three themes for the mothers’ adaptation and wellbeing development were identified, including Problem realisation within the context: Learning to spell A-U-T-I-S-M in Malaysia, WE are living with autism, and Resilient overcoming: Climbing Mount Kinabalu. The mothers viewed their child’s ASD symptoms and behaviour problems (e.g., hyperactivity and sleep difficulties) as taking a toll on wellbeing. However, coping strategies, including acceptance, proactive mindset, character growth, spirituality, and parent support networks, fostered wellbeing.

The contrasting predictions draw on group competition and group threat theories and propose that working with racially similar others might increase competition for resources and generate a backlash effect against minorities that would induce their turnover. Furthermore, this relationship is nonlinear: Members of minority groups with very small representation benefited more from the increased presence of their own race than minorities who already had a substantial presence. This finding suggests a potential backlash effect at higher minority proportions. Interestingly, the proportion of other minorities in a job has a marginally significant, negative effect on employees' voluntary turnover.

In-depth interviews and participant observation with 27 Hmong women (aged 20+ yrs) who are now living in Melbourne, Australia were obtained for the study. The loss of pregnancy creates considerable anxiety in Hmong society. This is not only because it calls for a socially justifiable explanation for a family's failure to extend their lineage, but also reduces the venue for a soul to be re-born into the family. This is a threat for Hmong society since it means the extinction of the family, clan and lineage and hence Hmong society. The cultural construction of the causes of miscarriage among the Hmong surrounds 2 main categories: the natural world which is related to the woman's body and her behavior; and the supernatural world. These explanations point to the influence that individuals, both living and dead, have on pregnancies. In traditional Hmong society, health is perceived as a harmony between the social, and religious or supernatural realm. A woman being unable to bring forth an offspring because of miscarriage indicates disharmony with the living and/or between the living and the dead.

There were errors in the author note and the Measures section. The omitted information in the author note and the corrected version of the last sentence in paragraph two of the Measures section are provided.] Many ethnic minorities in the United States consider themselves to be just as American as their European American counterparts. However, there is a persistent cultural stereotype of ethnic minorities as foreigners (i.e., the perpetual foreigner stereotype) that may be expressed during interpersonal interactions (i.e., foreigner objectification). The goal of the present study was to validate the Foreigner Objectification Scale, a brief self-report measure of perceived foreigner objectification, and to examine the psychological correlates of perceived foreigner objectification. Results indicated that the Foreigner Objectification Scale is structurally (i.e., factor structure) and metrically (i.e., factor loadings) invariant across foreign-born and U.S.-born Asian Americans and Latinos. Scalar (i.e., latent item intercepts) invariance was demonstrated for the two foreign-born groups and the two U.S.-born groups, but not across foreign-born and U.S.-born individuals.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-14946-002[/rid].) Many ethnic minorities in the United States consider themselves to be just as American as their European American counterparts. However, there is a persistent cultural stereotype of ethnic minorities as foreigners (i.e., the perpetual foreigner stereotype) that may be expressed during interpersonal interactions (i.e., foreigner objectification). The goal of the present study was to validate the Foreigner Objectification Scale, a brief self-report measure of perceived foreigner objectification, and to examine the psychological correlates of perceived foreigner objectification. Results indicated that the Foreigner Objectification Scale is structurally (i.e., factor structure) and metrically (i.e., factor loadings) invariant across foreign-born and U.S.-born Asian Americans and Latinos. Scalar (i.e., latent item intercepts) invariance was demonstrated for the two foreign-born groups and the two U.S.-born groups, but not across foreign-born and U.S.-born individuals. Multiple-group structural equation models indicated that, among U.S.-born individuals, perceived foreigner objectification was associated with less life satisfaction and more depressive symptoms, and was indirectly associated with lower self-esteem via identity denial, operationalized as the perception that one is not viewed by others as American. Among foreign-born individuals, perceived foreigner objectification was not significantly associated directly with self-esteem, life satisfaction, or depressive symptoms. However, perceived foreigner objectification was positively associated with identity denial, and identity denial was negatively associated with life satisfaction. This study illustrates the relevance of perceived foreigner objectification to the psychological well-being of U.S.-born Asian Americans and Latinos.

Drawing on our experiences as two white British researchers, conducting a study with internationally educated nurses from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, we consider how our analysis led us to a more nuanced understanding of the data than might have occurred without reflectivity. We identified our respective standpoints, confronted our feared biases, particularly in relation to social stereotyping and prejudice, and located ourselves as co-producers of the data. This enabled us to consider how we might be representing, holding and paralleling, systemic patterns of discrimination, leading to several new insights. Reflective practice is often referred to in theory, less often in application. We hope that sharing our reflective process will benefit other researchers navigating the complex waters of identifying themselves in their research.

"Who's at risk? Ethnic drinking cultures, foreign nativity, and problem drinking among Asian American young adults.","Cook, Won Kim; Bond, Jason; Karriker-Jaffe, Katherine J.; Zemore, Sarah",Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs,19371888,,20130701,74,4,532,10,2013-22276-004,10.15288/jsad.2013.74.532,Alcohol Research Documentation,Journal Article,Alcohol Abuse; Alcohol Drinking Attitudes; Asians; Ethnic Identity; Indigenous Populations; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Thirties (30-39 yrs); Male; Female,,"Objective: Despite the low overall prevalence of alcohol use among Asian Americans, rates of alcohol use disorder are high among Asian American young adults. The influence of ethnic drinking cultures on immigrants and their descendants has been overlooked in past research. We took an integrative approach to examine the influence of ethnic drinking culture, acculturation, and socioeconomic disparities on problem drinking among Asian American young adults. Method: This study was a nationally representative sample of 854 Asian American young adults extracted from the Wave 4 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data. About 48% of the sample was female and 52% male. Several multiple logistic regression models were fitted. Results: Controlling for other covariates, two dimensions of ethnic drinking culture were associated with alcohol outcomes only for the foreign born: (a) detrimental drinking pattern with frequent drunkenness and alcohol-abuse symptoms and (b) drinking prevalence with alcohol-dependence symptoms. Financial hardship was a significant predictor of symptoms of alcohol abuse and dependence only for the U.S. born. Asian language use was protective against alcohol-abuse symptoms and alcohol-dependence symptoms for the foreign born. Conclusions: Cultural and socioeconomic factors of problem drinking may be different for U.S.- and foreign-born Asian American young adults. Ethnic drinking cultures may significantly influence problem drinking of foreign-born Asian American young adults, independent of their acculturation into U.S. cultures. To inform effective interventions targeted at immigrants and their descendants, future research might further investigate the cultural and socioeconomic processes in immigrant communities that might significantly influence drinking.

The study collected 3 years of personnel data from 10 business units of a US financial firm, using a data sample of 8,918 employees. Documents regarding personnel practices and information on market conditions were also gathered. Findings indicate that Whites are less likely to be laid off than non-Whites, and that, among non-Whites, Asians are less likely to be laid off than Blacks or Hispanics. These findings are statistically significant after controlling for structural factors (business unit, occupation, and job level) and individual characteristics (tenure and performance rating). A similar pattern of racial differences exists in other employment practices more actively monitored by the firm, including promotions, pay raises, and performance ratings. Yet these differences are smaller than those in layoffs and are significant for Blacks only, not for Hispanics. Our findings suggest that monitoring personnel decisions can reduce racial inequality. Furthermore, our findings highlight that racial differences in employment outcomes vary among minority groups.

Results indicated that Japanese and Asian-Canadians were more self-critical than Euro-Canadians, both under high- and low-attentional load. This cultural difference was partially mediated by relational mobility. The IATSE showed no cultural differences, but this measure did not positively correlate with any of the other measures in the study, suggesting that it is not a valid measure of 'true' self-feelings.

Women (Study 1), and Asians and Blacks (Study 2) reacted to negative feedback after information about the probability for discrimination. Minority group members tended to minimize discrimination and attributed their failure to themselves. By perceiving discrimination as a reason for failure, minority group members protected their performance state self-esteem. In contrast, by minimizing discrimination, they protected their social state self-esteem and maintained the perception of control in the performance and social domains. Results suggest that minority group members minimize discrimination because the consequences of doing so are psychologically beneficial.

Many New Zealanders come from cultures that do not have a history of gambling, including the Mäori (New Zealand indigenous people), Pacific Islanders, and recent migrants. Little research has examined the reasons why people start and continue to gamble, especially among different ethnic groups. This research project thus aimed to develop a framework to explain how environmental, cultural, and social factors interact with personal attributes to determine gambling behaviors. In a qualitative study, 131 people broadly representative of Mäori, Pacific, Asian, and Päkehä/New Zealand European groups residing in New Zealand were interviewed individually or in focus groups. They included social and problem gamblers, families of problem gamblers, and professionals. Different personal, socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural factors were identified, summarized in a developmental framework, and compared to factors found for ethnic groups in other countries. Public health policy issues were raised, including greater control of gambling promotion.

Ss were 466 White vs Asian college students (aged 17–35 yrs). The studies examined how the attribution of harm was influenced by variables such as group membership, message severity, message explicitness, and the medium of presentation. One finding in particular, an interaction between group membership and message explicitness (direct vs indirect), emerged across the 3 studies. Results reveal that as 'objective' evaluators of deprecating speech, outgroup members attributed the direct messages of racism to be more harmful than ingroup members did, but, conversely, ingroup members evaluated the indirect messages of racism to be more harmful than the outgroup members did. Theoretical explanations for this finding and its resulting legal implications are discussed.

Qualitative group discussions with PHCTs were set up by four health centers in the Grangetown area of Cardiff, where a large proportion of the Bangladeshi community lives. Health visitors had made significantly more effort than others to get to know their Bangladeshi patients. Cutting across this difference were common themes such as communication and cultural differences, and patients' difficulties in using NHS services appropriately, which caused disruption and frustration. While there was an awareness of the reasons for these difficulties, PHCTs generally were not able to allow for them because of the inflexibility of their workload and systems of working. PHCTs are aware of their patients' needs and keen to explore racial awareness training and new ways of looking at how they work. However, the grind of heavy workloads makes this process unlikely without outside facilitation.

Design/methodology/approach: The dataset used in this study consists of 255 employees and their 86 direct supervisors in two IJVs in China. The authors adopted LISREL to test a proposed model and investigate the following relationships: subordinate-supervisor guanxi as an antecedent of commitment to supervisor and organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB), job security as an antecedent of affective commitment, and their impact on employee turnover intention. Findings: The empirical results show that subordinate-supervisor workplace guanxi has positive and significant effect on commitment to supervisor, whereas commitment to supervisor has positive and significant effect on affective commitment and organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) of employees. Such relationships further lead to reduced employee turnover intention. Research limitations/implications: This study reveals the significance of workplace guanxi and commitment to supervisor and their impact on other important HRM outcome variables in Chinese IJV employees. It contributes to the literature by offering insight on how Chinese guanxi culture interacts with other HRM variables in IJVs and informs future research in relation to leader-member exchange in the Chinese context. Practical implications: By establishing a healthy workplace guanxi with employees, supervisors can play a critical role in achieving desired organization outcomes such as improving affective commitment and reducing turnover. Originality/value: Existing research shows that guanxi is a multi-dimensional construct and critical for Chinese HRM research. This study examines the dimension of workplace guanxi and investigates the impact of subordinate-supervisor guanxi on commitment to supervisor and other HRM outcome variables in IJVs.
